Scenario 1: Test to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value
Details:
  TestName: testCorrectPriceReturned
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value for a given book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book object with a known price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the book object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the known price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method accurately returns the price of the book. The expected result is the known price because that's what we set the book's price to be. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the getPrice method.
Scenario 2: Test to check if the getPrice method returns a default value for an uninitialized price
Details:
  TestName: testDefaultValueReturnedForUninitializedPrice
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a default value when the price of a book is not initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book object without initializing the price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the book object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the default value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method returns a default value when the price is not initialized. The expected result is the default value because the price was not set. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the getPrice method in case of uninitialized price.
Scenario 3: Test to check if the getPrice method returns a correct value after the price has been changed
Details:
  TestName: testCorrectPriceReturnedAfterChange
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value after the price of a book has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book object with a known price. Then change the price to a new known value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the book object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the new price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method accurately returns the updated price of the book. The expected result is the new price because that's what we changed the book's price to be. This test is significant as it validates the functionality of the getPrice method after a price change.
