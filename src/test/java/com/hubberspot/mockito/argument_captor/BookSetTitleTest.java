"""
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Title
Details:
    TestName: setValidTitle.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setTitle method correctly assigns the title when a valid string is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Book object and assign a valid title String.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the valid title String.
    Assert: Assert that the title field of the Book object is equal to the valid title String.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the setTitle method can successfully assign the title property of the Book object correctly when passed a valid string. This is significant in the larger application context, as ensuring a book has a correct title is integral to book classification and searching functionalities.
Scenario 2: Test for Null Title
Details:
    TestName: setNullTitle.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setTitle method when a null string is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Book object.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with null as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown, or the title field of the Book object is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion is to verify how the setTitle method handles null inputs. It is important to test this edge case to ensure the application can handle null values gracefully without breaking.
Scenario 3: Test for Empty Title
Details:
    TestName: setEmptyTitle.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setTitle method responds correctly when an empty string is passed as the title.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Book object.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with an empty string as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown, or the title field of the Book object remains null or becomes an empty string.
  Validation:
    This assertion is checking how the setTitle method handles edge cases where an empty string is passed. This is important in preventing empty title fields from being saved in the database.
Scenario 4: Test for Long Title
Details:
    TestName: setLongTitle.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setTitle method can handle long strings without issues, which could occur as some book titles are quite lengthy.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Book object with a long title String (above the normal limits).
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the long title String.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown, or the title field of the Book object is set to the long title string.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify how the method handles long strings as input. Knowing how the setTitle method handles long strings will help understand the situations under which it might fail.
