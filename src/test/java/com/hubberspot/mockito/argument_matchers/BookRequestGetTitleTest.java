  Details:
    TestName: checkTitleReturnAfterChange
    Description: This test aims to validate that getTitle() updates and correctly returns the new title after it’s been changed.

    Act: Call the getTitle() method on the object.
    Assert: Assert that the received value is equal to the newly set title.
  Validation:
    This scenario confirms that the getTitle() method can accurately retrieve the title value even after it has been changed.
- Scenario 4: Test to ensure getTitle is independent, does not return other properties.
  Details:
    TestName: ensureTitleIndependence
    Description: This test aims to confirm that getTitle() does not return the value of other properties in the class. For instance, it should not return the price or the publishedDate.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class, set title, price and publishedDate.
    Act: Call the getTitle() method on the object.
