"""
  Scenario 1: Test getTitle method when the title is null.
  Details:
    TestName: getTitleWhenTitleIsNull
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getTitle method when the title of the book object is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book object with null title.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect null as the output.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the title of the book to be null when not specifically assigned. If the title is unassigned, the method should return null.
  Scenario 2: Test getTitle method when the title is an empty string.
  Details:
    TestName: getTitleWhenTitleIsEmpty
    Description: This test is meant to evaluate the functionality of the getTitle method when the title of the book object is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book object with an empty string as the title.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an empty string as the output.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the title of the book is retrieved as an empty string when it's assigned as the same. Even though it's an unwanted scenario in real time, the method should return the actual value what it contains.
  Scenario 3: Test getTitle method when the book object has a title.
  Details:
    TestName: getTitleWhenTitleExists
    Description: This test checks the functionality of getTitle method when the title of the book object is present.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book object with a valid title.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect the same title as given to the object.
  Validation:
    This assertion validates the ability of the getTitle method to retrieve the correct value of the title when the book object has a valid title. Providing a title is most common real-time scenario and we can know about the correct assignment and retrieval of title value through this test.
