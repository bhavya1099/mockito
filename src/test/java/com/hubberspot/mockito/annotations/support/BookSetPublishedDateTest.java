"""
Scenario 1: Valid date input test
Details:
  - TestName: testValidDateInput
  - Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles and sets a valid date input as the publishedDate.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a new instance of the Book class and a LocalDate object with a valid date.
  - Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the created LocalDate as an argument.
  - Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the publishedDate field of the Book instance equals the provided date.
Validation:
  - The assertion aims to verify that the setPublishedDate method correctly sets the publishedDate field when given a valid date. This test is important as it ensures that normal, valid behavior is handled correctly.
Scenario 2: Null date input test
Details:
  - TestName: testNullDateInput
  - Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles a null date input, without throwing an exception.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a new instance of the Book class.
  - Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with null as an argument.
  - Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the publishedDate field of the Book instance is null.
Validation:
  - The assertion aims to verify that the setPublishedDate method correctly handles a null input by setting the publishedDate field to null. This test is important as it ensures that edge cases, such as null inputs, are handled correctly.
Scenario 3: Future date input test
Details:
  - TestName: testFutureDateInput
  - Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles a date input that is in the future.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a new instance of the Book class and a LocalDate object with a date in the future.
  - Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the future date as an argument.
  - Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the publishedDate field of the Book instance equals the provided future date.
Validation:
  - The assertion aims to verify that the setPublishedDate method correctly handles dates in the future by setting the publishedDate field to that future date. This test is important as it checks that the system can handle future-dated books.
Scenario 4: Past date input test
Details:
  - TestName: testPastDateInput
  - Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles a date input that is in the past.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a new instance of the Book class and a LocalDate object with a date in the past.
  - Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the past date as an argument.
  - Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the publishedDate field of the Book instance equals the provided past date.
Validation:
  - The assertion aims to verify that the setPublishedDate method correctly handles dates in the past by setting the publishedDate field to that past date. This test is important as it checks that the system can handle past-dated books.
