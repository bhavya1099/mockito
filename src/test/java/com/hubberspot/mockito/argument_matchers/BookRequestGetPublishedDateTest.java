"""
  Scenario 1: Test to confirm if null date is returned when the book hasn't been published yet.
  Details:
    TestName: testNullOnUnpublishedBooks.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getPublishedDate() function returns null for a book which hasn't been published yet.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Crate a book instance, but do not set the publishedDate attribute.
    Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the book instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getPublishedDate method works accurately for unpublished books. The expected result (null) is logical because the book hasn't been published yet. This test is important to ensure the functionality of the application when dealing with yet-to-be-published books.
  Scenario 2: Test to confirm if correct date is returned when the book has been published.
  Details:
    TestName: testCorrectDateOnPublishedBooks.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getPublishedDate() function returns the correct date when a book has been published.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book instance, and set the publishedDate attribute to a known LocalDate.
    Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the book instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned date matches the known LocalDate set earlier.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getPublishedDate method works accurately and fetches the correct date for published books. It is important to ensure that the functionality of the application is as expected when dealing with already published books.
  Scenario 3: Test to verify if getPublishedDate function affects other attributes.
  Details:
    TestName: testNoEffectOnOtherAttributes.
    Description: This test is meant to check that invoking the getPublishedDate() function does not alter any other attribute of the book instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book instance and set known values for all other attributes (title, price).
    Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the book instance.
    Assert: Assert that the values for all other attributes (title, price) are unchanged.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify the function's side-effect freeness. The function should only fetch the published date and not alter any other data. This test is important in ensuring data integrity.
