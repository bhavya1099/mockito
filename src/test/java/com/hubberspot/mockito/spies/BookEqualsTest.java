"""
Scenario 1: Test Equals Method with Same Object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObject
  Description: This test is designed to check the equals method when the same object is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the same book object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The equals method should return true because we are comparing the same object. This test ensures that the method correctly identifies when two objects are identical.
Scenario 2: Test Equals Method with Null Object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
  Description: This test is designed to check the equals method when a null object is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with a null object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The equals method should return false because we are comparing with a null object. This test ensures that the method correctly identifies when the other object is null.
Scenario 3: Test Equals Method with Different Class Object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test is designed to check the equals method when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and an object of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the different class object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The equals method should return false because we are comparing with an object of a different class. This test ensures that the method correctly identifies when the objects are of different classes.
Scenario 4: Test Equals Method with Different Book Object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentBookObject
  Description: This test is designed to check the equals method when a different book object is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two book objects with different attributes.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the different book object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The equals method should return false because we are comparing two different book objects. This test ensures that the method correctly identifies when the book objects are different.
Scenario 5: Test Equals Method with Identical Book Object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalBookObject
  Description: This test is designed to check the equals method when an identical book object is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical book objects.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the identical book object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The equals method should return true because we are comparing two identical book objects. This test ensures that the method correctly identifies when the book objects are identical.
