"""
Scenario 1: Testing positive price value

Details:
  TestName: setPositivePrice.
  Description: The test will check if the method can successfully set a positive price for a book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and set a positive price value (like 100).
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the positive price.
  Assert: Assert that the set price value returned by the getPrice method is equal to the provided positive price value.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the price is set correctly and is equal to the expected value. This confirms that the setPrice method is properly handling positive price value inputs.
Scenario 2: Testing zero price value
Details:
  TestName: setZeroPrice.
  Description: The test will check if the method can handle setting a zero price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and set a price value of 0.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the zero price.
  Assert: Assert that the set price value returned by the getPrice method is equal to 0.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the price is set correctly to 0 and is equal to the expected value. It confirms that the setPrice method is properly handling zero as a price input.
Scenario 3: Testing negative price value
Details:
  TestName: setNegativePrice.
  Description: The test will check if the method can handle setting a negative price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and set a negative price value (like -100).
  Act: Try to Invoke the setPrice method with the negative price.
  Assert: An exception should be thrown.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the system handles negative price inputs properly, preventing them from being set as valid price values - usually, book prices cannot be negative.
Scenario 4: Testing very large price value
Details:
  TestName: setLargePrice.
  Description: The test will check if the method can handle setting a very large price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and set a very large price value (like Integer.MAX_VALUE).
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the large price.
  Assert: Assert that the set price value returned by the getPrice method is equal to the provided large price value.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the price is set correctly and is equal to the expected large value. It confirms that the setPrice method can handle large price value inputs.
