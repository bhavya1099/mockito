"""
Scenario 1: Book objects are exactly the same
TestName: testEqualsForExactSameObjects
Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies two references of the same Book object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method comparing the Book to itself.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two references are to the exact same object.
  The significance of this test is that we expect two references of the same object to always be equal.
Scenario 2: Book objects are equal based on title, price, and publishedDate fields
TestName: testEqualsForIdenticalBookObjects
Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method accurately identifies when two different Book objects are equal based on title, price, and publishedDate fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical Book objects.
  Act: Invoke the equals method comparing the two Book objects.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method identifies when two different Book objects have the same title, price, and publishedDate.
  The significance is ensuring that Books are seen as equal if their characteristics match, for instance in inventory or cataloguing systems.
Scenario 3: Book objects have different title, price, and publishedDate fields
TestName: testEqualsForDifferentBookObjects
Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method accurately identifies when two different Book objects are not equal based on title, price, and publishedDate fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Book objects.
  Act: Invoke the equals method comparing the two Book objects.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two different Book objects have different title, price, and publishedDate fields.
  The significance is ensuring Books with different characteristics are not seen as equal.
Scenario 4: Comparing a Book object to null
TestName: testEqualsWhenComparedToNull
Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method accurately returns false when a Book object is compared to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method comparing the Book object to null.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly returns false when a Book object is compared to null.
  The significance of this is proper error handling and avoiding NullPointerException.

Scenario 5: Comparing a Book object to a different type of object
TestName: testEqualsWhenComparedToDifferentObjectType
Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when a Book object is compared to an object of a different type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and an object of a different type.
  Act: Invoke the equals method comparing the Book object to the differently typed object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the equals method correctly distinguishes Book objects from objects of other types.
  This is important for proper object identification in mixed collections and ensuring the integrity of type-specific operations on Book objects.
