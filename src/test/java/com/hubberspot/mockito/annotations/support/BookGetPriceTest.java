Based on the provided method and class information, here are several test scenarios for the `getPrice()` method:
Scenario 1: Verify Default Price Value
Details:
  TestName: verifyDefaultPriceValue
  Description: Check if the getPrice() method returns the default value of the price field when it hasn't been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class containing the getPrice() method without setting a price.
  Act: Call the getPrice() method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned price is 0 (assuming 0 is the default value for int fields in Java).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getPrice() method correctly returns the default value when the price hasn't been set. It's important to verify default behavior to prevent unexpected results in the application.
Scenario 2: Verify Positive Price Value
Details:
  TestName: verifyPositivePriceValue
  Description: Ensure that the getPrice() method returns the correct positive price value after it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set a positive price value (e.g., 19.99) using the appropriate setter method.
  Act: Call the getPrice() method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned price matches the set value (19.99).
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getPrice() method accurately returns the price when it has been set to a positive value, which is a common scenario for book prices.
Scenario 3: Verify Zero Price Value
Details:
  TestName: verifyZeroPriceValue
  Description: Check if the getPrice() method correctly handles a price set to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set the price to 0 using the appropriate setter method.
  Act: Call the getPrice() method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned price is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getPrice() method can handle a zero price, which might be used for free books or promotional items. It's important to verify that zero is treated as a valid price.
Scenario 4: Verify Negative Price Value
Details:
  TestName: verifyNegativePriceValue
  Description: Test the behavior of getPrice() when a negative price value has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set a negative price value (e.g., -10) using the appropriate setter method.
  Act: Call the getPrice() method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned price is -10.
Validation:
  While negative prices are unusual for books, this test ensures that the getPrice() method doesn't modify the stored value. It's important to test edge cases to understand how the method behaves with unexpected inputs.
Scenario 5: Verify Price Consistency Across Multiple Calls
Details:
  TestName: verifyPriceConsistency
  Description: Ensure that multiple calls to getPrice() return the same value without any internal changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set a specific price value.
  Act: Call the getPrice() method multiple times on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return the same price value.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getPrice() method is consistent and doesn't modify the price value between calls. It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and predictable behavior in the application.
Scenario 6: Verify Price Independence Between Instances
Details:
  TestName: verifyPriceIndependence
  Description: Check that different instances of the class can have different price values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the class and set different price values for each.
  Act: Call getPrice() on both instances.
  Assert: Verify that each instance returns its own unique price value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the price field is instance-specific and not shared across objects. It's important for maintaining the integrity of individual book price data in a system with multiple books.
These test scenarios cover various aspects of the getPrice() method, including default values, positive and negative inputs, zero handling, consistency, and instance independence. They aim to ensure the method behaves correctly under different conditions and maintains data integrity.
