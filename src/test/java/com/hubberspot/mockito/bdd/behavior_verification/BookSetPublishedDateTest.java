  Scenario 1: Test for setting a valid published date
  Details:
    TestName: testSetValidPublishedDate
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPublishedDate method successfully sets the provided date as the published date.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a LocalDate object with a valid date.
    Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the created LocalDate object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the publishedDate field with the LocalDate object created.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPublishedDate method correctly sets the provided date as the published date. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the setPublishedDate method.
  Scenario 2: Test for setting a null published date
  Details:
    TestName: testSetNullPublishedDate
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPublishedDate method can handle a null input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null LocalDate object.
    Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the null LocalDate object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the publishedDate field with null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPublishedDate method correctly handles a null input by setting the publishedDate field as null. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the setPublishedDate method.
  Scenario 3: Test for setting a future published date
  Details:
    TestName: testSetFuturePublishedDate
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPublishedDate method can handle a date in the future.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a LocalDate object with a future date.
    Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the future date LocalDate object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the publishedDate field with the future date LocalDate object.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPublishedDate method correctly handles a future date by setting the publishedDate field as the future date. This test is significant as it checks the ability of the setPublishedDate method to handle dates in the future.
  Scenario 4: Test for setting a past published date
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPastPublishedDate
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPublishedDate method can handle a date in the past.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a LocalDate object with a past date.
    Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the past date LocalDate object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the publishedDate field with the past date LocalDate object.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPublishedDate method correctly handles a past date by setting the publishedDate field as the past date. This test is significant as it checks the ability of the setPublishedDate method to handle dates in the past.
