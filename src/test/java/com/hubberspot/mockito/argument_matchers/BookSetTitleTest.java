"""
Scenario 1: Test to check a normal title assignment
Details:
  TestName: TestSetTitleWithNormalValue
  Description: This test is designed to check if the setTitle method is capable of setting a normal, non-null value as the title. It's a positive test case that tests regular functionality.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and a normal, non-empty string "Test Title".
  Act: Invoke setTitle with the aforementioned string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title of the book object is "Test Title".
Validation:
  This assertion checks if the setTitle method can set a non-empty string as a title. This is expected as it is the basic functionality of the setTitle method.
Scenario 2: Test setTitle with a null value
Details:
  TestName: TestSetTitleWithNullValue
  Description: This test is made to verify if the setTitle method can handle null values. It tests the method's resilience against null assignments, which could cause NullPointerExceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and a null string.
  Act: Invoke setTitle with the null string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title of the book object is null.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the method can set the title value to null, without causing any errors or exceptions. This is crucial to prevent NullPointerExceptions.
Scenario 3: Test setTitle with an empty string
Details:
  TestName: TestSetTitleWithEmptyString
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the setTitle method can handle an empty string. It is a negative test case to check how the method handles invalid data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and an empty string.
  Act: Invoke setTitle with the empty string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title of the book object is an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the setTitle method can accept and assign an empty string as a value. Although it doesn't hold any meaningful data, it is valid in terms of syntax and should not cause errors.
Scenario 4: Test setTitle with a long string
Details:
  TestName: TestSetTitleWithLongString
  Description: This test aims to check if the setTitle method can handle a long string. This tests the method's ability to handle data that exceeds standard size limitations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and a very long string.
  Act: Invoke setTitle with the long string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title of the book object matches the long string.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify if the setTitle method can handle extremely long strings, stretching the method's limitations. This is important to know to avoid potential data truncations or overflows.
