"""
Scenario 1: Testing hashCode for null values
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when all the fields (title, price, publishedDate) are null. As the Objects.hash method handles null values, no NullPointerException should be thrown.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the fields title, price, and publishedDate to null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Verify that the method does not throw a NullPointerException and returns a valid hash code.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the Objects.hash method can handle null values. This is significant as it ensures the application's robustness and error handling capabilities.
Scenario 2: Testing hashCode for non-null values
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when all the fields are non-null. It is expected to return a unique hash code for the given field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the fields title, price, and publishedDate to some non-null values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns a valid hash code.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly uses the Objects.hash method to create a hash code from the field values. This is significant as it ensures the uniqueness of the hash code for distinct objects.
Scenario 3: Testing hashCode for identical objects
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeForIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method for two objects with identical field values. It is expected to return the same hash code for identical objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with identical field values for title, price, and publishedDate.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Verify that both hash codes are identical.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that identical objects produce the same hash code, ensuring the consistency and correctness of the hashCode method. This is significant as it is a fundamental principle of the hashCode contract.

Scenario 4: Testing hashCode for different objects
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeForDifferentObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method for two objects with different field values. It is expected to return different hash codes for distinct objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with different field values for title, price, and publishedDate.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Verify that both hash codes are different.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that distinct objects produce different hash codes, ensuring the uniqueness of the hashCode method. This is significant as it helps in distributing objects evenly across hash-based collections like HashMap, HashSet, etc.
