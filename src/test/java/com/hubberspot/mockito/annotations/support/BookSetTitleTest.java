### Scenario 1: Normal Title Set
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithNormalString
  Description: Test the setTitle method with a typical string value to ensure it sets the title properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setTitle method with a normal string value, such as "Java Programming".
  Assert: Check if the title field of the Book instance is set to "Java Programming".
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the title field is updated correctly when a valid string is passed. This test confirms the basic functionality of the setTitle method.
### Scenario 2: Null Title Set
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithNull
  Description: Verify that the setTitle method can handle null input without throwing an exception, and sets the title field to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setTitle method with a null value.
  Assert: Check if the title field of the Book instance is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the title field can be set to null, which might be necessary in scenarios where a book's title is not yet decided. This test is important for ensuring the robustness of the setTitle method against null inputs.
### Scenario 3: Empty String Title
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithEmptyString
  Description: Test if the setTitle method can set the title to an empty string without issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setTitle method with an empty string ("").
  Assert: Check if the title field of the Book instance is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the title field accepts an empty string, which is a valid case if the title is intentionally left blank. This test checks the flexibility of the setTitle method.
### Scenario 4: Long String Title
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithLongString
  Description: Ensure that the setTitle method can handle very long strings and sets the title field accordingly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setTitle method with a very long string (e.g., a string of 1000 characters).
  Assert: Check if the title field of the Book instance is set to the long string.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the title field can handle and store long strings without truncation or errors. This test is crucial for validating the method's ability to deal with unusually long titles.
### Scenario 5: Title with Special Characters
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Test the setTitle method with a title containing special characters to ensure it correctly sets such titles.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setTitle method with a string containing special characters, such as "C++ Programming: Basics & Beyond!".
  Assert: Check if the title field of the Book instance reflects the special characters accurately.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the title field accurately captures titles with special characters, which is important for books that might have symbols in their titles. This test ensures the method's capability to handle a variety of character types.
