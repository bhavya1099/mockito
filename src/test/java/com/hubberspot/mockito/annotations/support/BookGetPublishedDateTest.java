Scenario 1: Published Date is Not Set
Details:
  TestName: checkPublishedDateWhenNotSet
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the publishedDate of a book has not been initialized or set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class without setting the publishedDate.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Verifies that the method correctly returns a null value when the publishedDate has not been initialized, reflecting the initial state of the object.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensures that the system can handle cases where book publication dates are not available, preventing any unexpected behavior or errors in such situations.
Scenario 2: Published Date is Set
Details:
  TestName: checkPublishedDateWhenSet
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the publishedDate of a book has been explicitly set to a specific date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and set a specific LocalDate as the publishedDate.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the date that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Verifies that the getPublishedDate method accurately retrieves the date that was set, ensuring data integrity.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Important for confirming that users or systems receive correct information about book publication dates, crucial for inventory, cataloging, and sales processes.
Scenario 3: Default Initialization of Published Date
Details:
  TestName: checkDefaultInitializationOfPublishedDate
  Description: This test checks the default behavior of the publishedDate field when a new Book object is instantiated but the date is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Book object without modifying the publishedDate.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the newly created Book instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Tests that the default state of publishedDate is null if not explicitly initialized, ensuring the class behaves as expected in its default state.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Validates that the system behaves predictably with newly created book objects, preventing unintended behavior due to uninitialized dates.
