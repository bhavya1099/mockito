  Scenario 1: Testing hashCode with all attributes set to null

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWhenAllAttributesAreNull.
    Description: This test checks the hashCode method for a scenario when all the attributes are null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book object with all attributes set to null.
    Act: Call the hashCode method on the created book object.
    Assert: Check if the returned hashCode is zero as it should be the result of Objects.hash applied for null values.
  Validation:
    This test is checking if the hashCode method handles the null attributes correctly. If the test fails, it means the hashCode method is not compatible with null attributes.
  Scenario 2: Testing hashCode for two objects with the same attribute values

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeForIdenticalObjects.
    Description: This test checks the hashCode method for a scenario where two objects with the same attributes values are created.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two book objects with the same attributes values.
    Act: Call the hashCode method on these book objects.
    Assert: Check if the returned hashCodes for both objects are the same.
  Validation:
    This test is validating the fact that the hashCode of two objects with the same attributes value should be the same. If this test fails, it suggests that hashCode is not being calculated correctly.
  Scenario 3: Testing hashCode for two objects with different attribute values

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeForDifferentObjects.
    Description: This test checks the hashCode method for a scenario where two objects with different attributes values are created.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two book objects with different attribute values.
    Act: Call the hashCode method on these book objects.
    Assert: Check if the returned hashCodes for both objects are different.
  Validation:
    This test is validating the fact that the hashCode of two objects with different values should be different. If this test fails, it suggests that hashCode is not unique for different objects.
  Scenario 4: Testing hashCode for the same object

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeForSameObject.
    Description: This test checks the hashCode method for a scenario where the same object is tested twice.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book object.
    Act: Call the hashCode method the book object, twice consecutively.
    Assert: Check if the returned hashCode for both calls are the same.
  Validation:
    This test is validating the fact that the hashCode of the same object should remain the same across multiple calls. If this test fails, it suggests that hashCode is not consistently the same for the same object.
