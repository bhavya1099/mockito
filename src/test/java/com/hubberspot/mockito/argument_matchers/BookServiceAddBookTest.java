"""
Scenario 1: Test for a book with a price below or equals to 500.
Details:
  TestName: testAddBookWithInvalidPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the addBook method correctly handles the scenario when trying to add a book with a price lower than or equals to 500. In such a case, the method should return without performing any action.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object with a price less than or equals to 500. Initialize a mock for the bookRepository.
  Act: Invoke the addBook method with the newly created book object.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository.save method was not called.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that attempting to add a book priced less than or equals to 500 results in no action being taken, as intended in the method implementation. This prevents incorrectly priced books from being added to the repository, maintaining correct data integrity.
Scenario 2: Test for a book with a price above 500.
Details:
  TestName: testAddBookWithValidPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the addBook method correctly adds books with a price greater than 500 to the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object with a price above 500. Initialize a mock for the bookRepository.
  Act: Invoke the addBook method with the newly created book object.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository.save method was called exactly once with the book object as the argument.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a book with a valid price is added once to the repository. This ensures that books priced appropriately are saved in the repository as expected, demonstrating correct functionality of the method.
Scenario 3: Test for a book with a negative price.
Details:
  TestName: testAddBookWithNegativePrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when trying to add a book with a negative price. As the price field is negative and thus falls under the condition of being less than or equal to 500, the method should return without performing any action.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object with a negative price. Initialize a mock for the bookRepository.
  Act: Invoke the addBook method with the book object.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository.save method was not called.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that a book with a negative price value is not added to the repository, protecting the data integrity of the repository. Ensuring that incorrectly priced books are not added can prevent potential bugs and issues arising from invalid book data.
