Scenario 1: Testing getPublishedDate method correctly returns the publication date
Details:
  TestName: testGetPublishedDateReturnsCorrectly
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPublishedDate() method correctly returns the publication date of the book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book object with the published date.
  Act: Invoke getPublishedDate() method for that book.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the same as the set date.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies the correct working of the getPublishedDate() method. The method should return the exact date set as the published date of the book. The correctness of this data is critical as it informs users when the book was published.
Scenario 2: Testing getPublishedDate method correctly returns null when no publication date is set
Details:
  TestName: testGetPublishedDateReturnsNull
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPublishedDate() method correctly returns null when no publication date was set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book object without a publication date.
  Act: Invoke getPublisherDate() method for that book.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test verifies that getPublishedDate() appropriately handles the case when a book has its default null publication date. When a book doesn't have set publication dates, it signifies that it's not yet published or the date is unavailable, and the method should return null.
Scenario 3: Testing getPublishedDate method following changes to the publication date
Details:
  TestName: testGetPublishedDateReturnsUpdatedDate
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPublishedDate() method returns the updated publication date following changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book object and set an initial publication date. Later, update the publication date.
  Act: Invoke getPublishedDate() method after the update.
  Assert: Check if the returned date is the updated date.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPublishedDate() method reflects changes to the publication date. When the publication date changes, the method should return the updated date. This ensures that users always have access to the latest information.
