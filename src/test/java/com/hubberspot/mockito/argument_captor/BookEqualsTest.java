"""
Scenario 1: Test case to verify object equality by reference
Details:
  TestName: testIfEqualByReference
  Description: This test is meant to check the equality of two objects by reference.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by making object compare itself.
  Assert: AssertTrue as it should return true as it's the same object.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method is accurately comparing two references to the same object as equal.
Scenario 2: Test case to verify object inequality with null
Details:
  TestName: testWithNullObject
  Description: This test is intended to check the method's behavior when compared with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method on the object comparing with null.
  Assert: AssertFalse as it should return false.
Validation:
  This test is significant as it verifies that the equals method accurately identifies a null object as not equal to the instantiated Book object.
Scenario 3: Test case to check object equality with different class
Details:
  TestName: testWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when an object of a different class is used for comparison.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and a string object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the book object with the string object.
  Assert: AssertFalse as it should return false since the objects are of different classes.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the equals method correctly identifies objects of different classes as not equal.
Scenario 4: Test case for object equality with matching field values
Details:
  TestName: testWithEqualFieldValues
  Description: This particular test is designed to confirm if two Book objects, both having same title, price, and publishedDate are correctly considered as equals by the equals method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two book objects with same title, price, and publishedDate.
  Act: Invoke equals method, comparing the two book objects.
  Assert: AssertTrue because the titles, prices, and publishedDates of the two books are identical.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method is operating correctly and determining equality based on an object's fields and not its reference.

Scenario 5: Test case for object inequality with different field values
Details:
  TestName: testWithDifferentFieldValues
  Description: The purpose of this test is to determine whether the equals method correctly identifies two Book objects with differing titles, prices, or publishedDates as not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two book objects with different field values.
  Act: Invoke equals method comparing the two book objects.
  Assert: AssertFalse as the field values are not identical, the method should return false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals method can correctly identify when two objects of the same class but different field values are not equal.
