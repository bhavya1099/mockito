Scenario 1: Test Valid Positive Price
Details:
  TestName: testSetValidPositivePrice
  Description: Test is meant to check if the method correctly sets a valid positive price.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A valid positive price integer is declared.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the declared price.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set price with the declared price.
  Validation:
    This test is to verify that the method set a positive price correctly. Expect the stored price to be exactly the same as the declared positive price. This is significant in the context of storing book prices.
Scenario 2: Test Zero Price
Details:
  TestName: testSetZeroPrice
  Description: Test is meant to check if the method correctly sets a zero price.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A zero integer is declared.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with zero price
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set price with zero.
  Validation:
    This test is to verify that the method set a zero price correctly. Expect the stored price to be zero. It is possible for some books to be given for free, hence validating this scenario.
Scenario 3: Test Negative Price
Details:
  TestName: testSetNegativePrice
  Description: Test is meant to check how the method handles a negative price input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A negative integer is declared.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the declared negative integer.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an expected exception/ error is thrown.
  Validation:
    This test is to verify that method doesn't accept negative price value. It is not feasible for books to have negative prices participating in validation of system's robustness.
Scenario 4: Test Large Integer
Details:
  TestName: testSetLargePrice
  Description: Test is meant to check if the method correctly sets a very large price.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A large positive integer is declared.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the declared large integer.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set price with the declared large integer.
  Validation:
    This test is to verify that the method can handle large integer inputs. It is feasible that some expensive hardcover or collector books may have very high prices, hence validating this scenario.
Scenario 5: Test Changing Price
Details:
  TestName: testSetChangingPrice
  Description: Test is meant to check if the method correctly sets a different price if invoked several times.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Two different valid positive prices are declared.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the first price, then invoke the setPrice method with the second price.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set price with the second price.
  Validation:
   This test is to verify that the method correctly updates the price if set multiple times. This is significant as book prices can change frequently due to sales or updates.
