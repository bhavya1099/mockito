Scenario 1: Add a book with a price greater than 500
Details:
  TestName: addBookWithHighPrice
  Description: The test aims to validate the scenario where the book has a price greater than 500 and is saved to the book repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object with the price set to be more than 500. Mock the book repository to capture the save method calls.
  Act: Call the addBook method with the created book object.
  Assert: Assert that the save method on the book repository was called with the created book object.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify that the book objects with a price greater than 500 are correctly added to the repository. It demonstrates the expected functionality of the condition in the addBook method.
Scenario 2: Add a book with a price less than or equal to 500
Details:
  TestName: addBookWithLowOrEqualPrice
  Description: The test aims to validate the scenario where the book has a price less than or equal to 500 and as such, is not saved to the book repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object with the price set to be less than or equal to 500. Mock the book repository to capture the save method calls.
  Act: Call the addBook method with the created book object.
  Assert: Assert that the save method on the book repository was never called.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify that the book objects with a price less than or equal to 500 are not added to the repository. It shows that the addBook method performs the correct filtering based on the price field.
Scenario 3: Add a null book
Details:
  TestName: addNullBook
  Description: The test aims to handle the scenario where a null book is passed, and ensures that it does not throw any unwanted exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Nothing needs to be arranged in this case as the book object is null.
  Act: Call the addBook method with a null book object.
  Assert: Assert that no exception was thrown. Also, assert that the save method on the book repository was never called.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify that the addBook method correctly handles when a null object is passed. It checks that such inputs do not disrupt normal operation and that they don't get added to the repository.
