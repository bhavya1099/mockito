Scenario 1: Test when a valid publishedDate is set
Details:
  TestName: testWhenValidPublishedDateIsSet.
  Description: This test aims to check the functionality of the setPublishedDate with a valid LocalDate object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid LocalDate object.
  Act: Call setPublishedDate with the created LocalDate object.
  Assert: Get the publishedDate from the object, and assert it equals the originally set date.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the publishedDate has been correctly set in the object. This is crucial to check if the setter for publishedDate is functioning properly.
Scenario 2: Test when the publishedDate is set to null
Details:
  TestName: testWhenPublishedDateIsSetToNull.
  Description: This test will check the behaviour of the setPublishedDate method when null is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup data is required for this test.
  Act: Call setPublishedDate with null parameter.
  Assert: Get the publishedDate from the object, and assert it equals null.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that when null is passed in setPublishedDate, the publishedDate in the object is set to null. This is an important scenario to validate the behaviour of setter when an null value is provided.
Scenario 3: Test when setting the publishedDate in future
Details:
  TestName: testWhenSettingPublishedDateInFuture.
  Description: This test will check the behaviour of the setPublishedDate when attempting to set a date in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: Arrange a LocalDate instance set to a future date.
  Act: Call setPublishedDate with the future date parameter.
  Assert: Get the publishedDate from the object, and assert it is equal to the future date.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that it is indeed possible to set a publishedDate in the future. This is an important scenario as according to business logic, the publishedDate can be in the future for upcoming books and digital content.
Scenario 4: Test when setting the publishedDate in the past
Details:
  TestName: testWhenSettingPublishedDateInThePast.
  Description: This test will check the behaviour of the setPublishedDate when attempting to set a date in the past.
Execution:
  Arrange: Arrange a LocalDate instance set to a past date.
  Act: Call setPublishedDate with the past date parameter.
  Assert: Get the publishedDate from the object, and assert it is equal to the past date.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that it is indeed possible to set a publishedDate in the past. This is an important scenario as according to business logic, the publishedDate can be in the past for already published books and digital content.
