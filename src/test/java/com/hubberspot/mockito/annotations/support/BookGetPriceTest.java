Scenario 1: Test for getting the price when it's initialized with a default value
Details:
  TestName: testGettingDefaultPrice
  Description: The test is aimed to verify if we can get the default price of a book when the field price is initially set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the book object without initializing the price field,
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method without setting the price.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion will verify if the default price of the book is zero. This test is significant as it helps in ensuring that the price won't be null if no price has been set priorly.

Scenario 2: Test for getting the price after setting it.
Details:
  TestName: testGettingPriceAfterSetting
  Description: The test will verify if we can successfully get the price of a book after it is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the book object and set the price to a specific value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the value set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns the assigned price without any alteration. The test is important in verifying the correctness and integrity of the price value.

Scenario 3: Test for getting the price when it's negative
Details:
  TestName: testGettingNegativePrice
  Description: This test aims to check if the price returned is negative when it's initially set to a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the book object with the price set to a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the negative value set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method will return exactly what is set as a price even if it's negative. This test is important to verify that no additional constraints are imposed on price itself by getPrice method.
