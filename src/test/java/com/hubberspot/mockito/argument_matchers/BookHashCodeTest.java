Scenario 1: Checking the hashcode for identical books
Details:
  TestName: checkHashForIdenticalBooks.
  Description: This test checks if the hashcode method generates the same hash for two identical books. This means that the title, price and publishedDate of the two books are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two book objects with the same title, price, and publishedDate.
  Act: Calculate the hash of both books using the hashCode() method.
  Assert: Check if the hashes of both books are equal.
Validation: Hashcode of two identical objects should be same(i.e. obeying general contract of hashCode). This helps ensure that identical books are not added multiple times to a HashSet or HashMap, for example.
Scenario 2: Checking the hashcode for different books
Details:
  TestName: checkHashForDifferentBooks.
  Description: This test checks if the hashcode method generates distinct hashes for two books with different details.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two book objects with different title, price and publishedDate.
  Act: Calculate the hash of both books using the hashCode() method.
  Assert: Check that the hashes of both books are not equal.
Validation: Hashcode of two different objects should typically be distinct. It's important to verify that the hashCode() method is working as expected, since incorrect implementations can lead to problems when using data structures such as HashMap or HashSet.
Scenario 3: Checking the hashcode for book with null values
Details:
  TestName: checkHashForBookWithNullValues.
  Description: The test checks the behavior of the hashCode method when some or all of the object properties are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object with null title, price, and publishedDate.
  Act: Generate the hash of the book using the hashCode() method.
  Assert: Check that the hash generated is not null or zero.
Validation: Even if object's properties i.e., title, price, and publishedDate are null, hashCode() should not return zero or null. This is important as it validates the robustness of the hashCode method against null properties.
Scenario 4: Checking for hashcode consistency
Details:
  TestName: checkHashConsistency.
  Description: This test checks that repeated invocations of hashCode should consistently return the same integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object.
  Act: Calculate the hash of the book multiple times using the hashCode() method.
  Assert: Check that the same integer is returned each time.
Validation: By ensuring that the hashCode method returns consistent values for the same object, we ensure that objects can be reliably used in data structures that depend on consistent hash values for their operations, like HashSet or HashMap.
Scenario 5: Testing Hashcode with changed state
Details:
  TestName: TestHashWithChangedState.
  Description: This test is to verify if hashCode changes when we modify the state of an Object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and calculate its hash.
  Act: Change the state of the book object and calculate its hash code again.
  Assert: Check that the hash values before and after the state change are different.
Validation: The hashcode value of an object should change if its state is altered. This check is important in real world applications where the state of an object can change and it's hash value should accurately represent that state.
