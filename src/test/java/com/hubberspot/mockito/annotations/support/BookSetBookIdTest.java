Scenario 1: Assign a valid book ID
Details:
  TestName: assignValidBookId
  Description: This test checks if a valid book ID string can be successfully assigned to the bookId field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setBookId method on the instance with a valid string identifier.
  Assert: Check if the bookId field of the instance matches the string passed to the setBookId method.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the bookId field is correctly updated when setBookId is called with a valid identifier. The significance of this test is to ensure that the book identification process works correctly, which is critical for inventory and tracking purposes.
Scenario 2: Assign a null book ID
Details:
  TestName: assignNullBookId
  Description: This test verifies that the bookId field can be set to null without throwing any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setBookId method on the instance with null as the argument.
  Assert: Check if the bookId field of the instance is null after the method call.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the bookId field can handle null values, which is important for scenarios where a book might not have been assigned an identifier yet. It also tests the robustness of the method in handling null inputs.
Scenario 3: Assign an empty string as book ID
Details:
  TestName: assignEmptyStringBookId
  Description: This test determines if the bookId field can be set to an empty string and evaluates how the system handles such cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setBookId method with an empty string ("").
  Assert: Validate that the bookId field is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion is crucial to check that the method correctly handles empty strings, which might be a potential input during data entry errors. It helps ensure that the system behaves predictably in such edge cases.
Scenario 4: Assign a very long string as book ID
Details:
  TestName: assignVeryLongStringBookId
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setBookId method when provided with a very long string, potentially exceeding typical length expectations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setBookId method with a very long string (e.g., 1000 characters).
  Assert: Ensure that the bookId field is updated to this long string without truncation.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the bookId field can handle unusually long strings, which might occur during system stress tests or unusual use cases. It's important for validating the robustness of the book ID handling logic.
Scenario 5: Reassign a different book ID to an already set bookId
Details:
  TestName: reassignDifferentBookId
  Description: This test checks if the bookId field can be successfully updated to a new value after it has already been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and set an initial bookId.
  Act: Call the setBookId method again on the same instance with a different valid book ID.
  Assert: Verify that the bookId field reflects the new book ID, not the original one.
Validation:
  This test ensures that updating the book ID is possible and works as expected, which is essential for scenarios where book IDs might need to be corrected or updated due to administrative reasons.
