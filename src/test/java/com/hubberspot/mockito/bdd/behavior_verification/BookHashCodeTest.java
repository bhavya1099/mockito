"""
Scenario 1: Testing hashCode for null values
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when all the fields (title, price, publishedDate) are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the title, price, and publishedDate fields to null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code is zero, as the hash of null values is zero.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method handles null values correctly. The expected result is zero since the hash of null values is zero. This test is significant because it checks the robustness of the hashCode method against null inputs.
Scenario 2: Testing hashCode for non-null values
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when all the fields (title, price, publishedDate) are not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the title, price, and publishedDate fields to non-null values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code is not zero.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly computes the hash of non-null values. The expected result is that the hash is non-zero, as the hash of non-null values should not be zero. This test is significant because it validates the basic functionality of the hashCode method.
Scenario 3: Testing hashCode for identical objects
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeForIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method for two identical objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with identical title, price, and publishedDate fields.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash codes are equal.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly computes the hash for identical objects. The expected result is that the hashes are equal, as identical objects should have the same hash. This test is significant because it validates the consistency of the hashCode method.

Scenario 4: Testing hashCode for different objects
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeForDifferentObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method for two different objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with different title, price, and publishedDate fields.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash codes are not equal.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly computes the hash for different objects. The expected result is that the hashes are not equal, as different objects should not have the same hash. This test is significant because it validates the distinctness of the hashCode method.
