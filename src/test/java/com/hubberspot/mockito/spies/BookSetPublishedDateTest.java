  Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct assignment of publishedDate

  Details:
    TestName: verifyCorrectAssignmentOfPublishedDate
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the setPublishedDate method correctly assigns the provided date to the publishedDate field.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a LocalDate object with a specific date.
    Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the created LocalDate object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the publishedDate field with the expected date.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the publishedDate field has been correctly updated with the provided date. The correct assignment of this field is essential for accurate book data management.
  Scenario 2: Test to verify the handling of null input for the publishedDate

  Details:
    TestName: verifyNullInputHandling
    Description: This test is meant to check how the setPublishedDate method handles null input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement as we're testing for a null input.
    Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with null as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the publishedDate field is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the publishedDate field is null when the setPublishedDate method is invoked with a null parameter. This test is critical to ensure the method can handle null inputs without causing a NullPointerException.
  Scenario 3: Test to verify the persistence of the previously set publishedDate after setting a new one

  Details:
    TestName: verifyPersistenceOfPreviouslySetPublishedDate
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the previous value of the publishedDate field is overwritten when a new date is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different LocalDate objects with specific dates.
    Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method twice, first with the first date, then with the second date.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the publishedDate field with the second date.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the publishedDate field is updated with the new date, overwriting the previous value. This test ensures that the method correctly updates the publishedDate field when called multiple times.
