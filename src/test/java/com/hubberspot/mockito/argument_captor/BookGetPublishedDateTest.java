"""
Scenario 1: Check the return value of getPublishedDate method when it has not been initialized
Details:
  Test Name: checkUninitializedPublishedDate
  Description: This test checks whether the getPublishedDate method returns null when the publishedDate field has not been initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the publishedDate.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
Validation:
  As per the class fields details provided, the publishedDate by default is null and will return null if it hasn't been set.
Scenario 2: Verify the getPublishedDate method successfully returns the set publishedDate
Details:
  Test Name: verifySetPublishedDate
  Description: This test verifies that the getPublishedDate method correctly returns the value that was set for the publishedDate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a value for publishedDate.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is the same as the value set for publishedDate.
Validation:
  The getPublishedDate should return the value that was previously set for the publishedDate field. The significance of this test is to ensure that our method correctly retrieves the value from the publishedDate field.
Scenario 3: Test the getPublishedDate method for thread safety
Details:
  Test Name: testThreadSafety
  Description: This test aims to verify if getPublishedDate is thread-safe.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple threads to simultaneously invoke the getPublishedDate method.
  Act: Initiate all threads and fetch the result.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that all threads return the same publishedDate.
Validation:
  When multiple threads are accessing the getPublishedDate method, all should return the same value. This suggests that the method is thread-safe.

Scenario 4: Verify getPublishedDate when the Date is in the future
Details:
  Test Name: testDateInFuture
  Description: This test verifies that the getPublishedDate method correctly returns the value that was set for the publishedDate when the date is in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a future value for publishedDate.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is the same value set for publishedDate.
Validation:
  The aim of this test is to verify that the getPublishedDate method can handle future dates properly.
