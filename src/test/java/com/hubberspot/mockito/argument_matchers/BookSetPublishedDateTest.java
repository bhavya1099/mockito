"""
Scenario 1: Test setting a valid published date
Details:
  TestName: testSettingValidPublishedDate
  Description: This test is meant to check whether a valid published date can be set successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new object of the class. Provide a valid 'publishedDate'.
  Act: Call 'setPublishedDate()' method with a predetermined valid 'publishedDate'.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that 'publishedDate' field of the class object has been set to the provided 'publishedDate'.
Validation:
  Ensure the 'publishedDate' property is updated to the provided value in a successful case. It is important in maintaining accurate records of when a book was published.
Scenario 2: Test setting a null published date
Details:
  TestName: testSettingNullPublishedDate
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the code when a null 'publishedDate' is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new object of the class.
  Act: Call 'setPublishedDate()' method with 'publishedDate' as null.
  Assert: Assert that the 'publishedDate' field of the class object is null.
Validation:
  The test verifies that 'publishedDate' property must not hold any value when 'publishedDate' is set to null. It indicates that the date is unspecified, perhaps because the book hasn't been published yet.
Scenario 3: Test for reseting an existing published date
Details:
  TestName: testResetExistingPublishedDate
  Description: This test is intended to verify if 'publishedDate' field can be reset to a new value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class. Set an initial 'publishedDate'.
  Act: Call 'setPublishedDate()' method again with a different 'publishedDate' value from the initial one.
  Assert: Assert that the 'publishedDate' field of the class object is updated to the new 'publishedDate'.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'publishedDate' property can be updated to a new value, which is critical when the published date for a book is rescheduled.
