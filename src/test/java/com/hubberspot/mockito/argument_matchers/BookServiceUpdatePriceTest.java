Scenario 1: Update Price with Valid Book ID

Details:
  TestName: updatePriceWithValidBookId
  Description: Tests if the method correctly updates the price of a book when provided with a valid book ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to return a specific Book object when findBookById is called with a valid ID. Prepare a book object with initial price settings.
  Act: Call updatePrice with the valid book ID and a new price.
  Assert: Verify that the book's setPrice method was called with the correct new price and that the bookRepository's save method was called with the book having the updated price.
Validation:
  This test validates that the price update mechanism works correctly when a valid book ID is provided. It ensures that the business logic of updating and saving the book's new price is properly executed.

Scenario 2: Update Price with Invalid Book ID

Details:
  TestName: updatePriceWithInvalidBookId
  Description: Tests the behavior of the method when an invalid or non-existent book ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the BookRepository mock to return null when findBookById is called with the invalid ID.
  Act: Call updatePrice with the invalid book ID and any price.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository's save method is not called.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's robustness against invalid input, ensuring that no operations are performed when the book ID does not correspond to any book in the repository. It helps prevent database errors or exceptions due to null operations.

Scenario 3: Update Price to a Negative Value

Details:
  TestName: updatePriceToNegativeValue
  Description: Tests the method's response when attempting to update the book's price to a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to return a specific Book object when findBookById is called. Prepare a book object with initial positive price.
  Act: Call updatePrice with a valid book ID but a negative price.
  Assert: Verify that the book's setPrice method was called with the negative price and that the bookRepository's save method was called with the book having the negative price.
Validation:
  This test examines how the method handles negative pricing, which could be significant if business rules do not allow negative prices. It is important for maintaining data integrity and business logic consistency.

Scenario 4: Update Price with Zero

Details:
  TestName: updatePriceToZero
  Description: Checks the method functionality when the price is updated to zero, assuming it is a valid operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to return a specific Book when findBookById is called. Prepare a book object with an initial positive price.
  Act: Call updatePrice with a valid book ID and a price of zero.
  Assert: Verify that the book's setPrice method was called with zero and that the bookRepository's save method was called with the updated book.
Validation:
  This scenario validates that setting a price to zero is handled correctly, which might be relevant for promotional or specific business cases. Ensuring that such updates are processed correctly is crucial for accurate pricing management.
