- Scenario 1: Test to check if getTitle returns null
  Details:
    TestName: checkTitleReturnNULL
    Description: This test aims to validate the getTitle() method when no title value has been set to the object, it should return null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class.
    Act: Call the getTitle() method on the object.
    Assert: Assert that the received value is null.
  Validation:
    This scenario is validating that the getTitle() method correctly works whit the default null value. Expected result is null because the title has not been set yet.
- Scenario 2: Test to check if getTitle returns the correct title after it’s set.
  Details:
    TestName: CheckTitleReturnAfterSet
    Description: This test aims to validate if the getTitle() method properly retrieves the title after it has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class and set title.
    Act: Call the getTitle() method on the object.
    Assert: Assert that the received value is equal to the set title.
  Validation:
    This scenario confirms that the getTitle() method appropriately retrieves the title that has previously been set.
- Scenario 3: Test to get the title after changing the title.
  Details:
    TestName: checkTitleReturnAfterChange
    Description: This test aims to validate that getTitle() updates and correctly returns the new title after it’s been changed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class, set a title, change the title.
    Act: Call the getTitle() method on the object.
    Assert: Assert that the received value is equal to the newly set title.
  Validation:
    This scenario confirms that the getTitle() method can accurately retrieve the title value even after it has been changed.
- Scenario 4: Test to ensure getTitle is independent, does not return other properties.
  Details:
    TestName: ensureTitleIndependence
    Description: This test aims to confirm that getTitle() does not return the value of other properties in the class. For instance, it should not return the price or the publishedDate.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class, set title, price and publishedDate.
    Act: Call the getTitle() method on the object.
    Assert: Assert that the received value is not equal to price or publishedDate.
  Validation:
    This scenario ensures that the getTitle() method retrieves correctly and is independent, not affected by other properties values.
