### Test Scenarios for `addBook(BookRequest bookRequest)` Method of BookService

---

**Scenario 1: Add Book with Price Above Threshold**

Details:
TestName: addBookWithPriceAboveThreshold
Description: This test verifies that a book with a price above 500 is successfully added to the repository.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a `BookRequest` with price greater than 500.
  - Act: Invoke `addBook(bookRequest)`.
  - Assert: Validate that the book is saved in the repository.
Validation:
  - The assertion checks if `bookRepository.save(book)` is called with the correct book details.
  - This test confirms the functionality that books priced above 500 are considered valid for addition, reflecting the business rule implemented.

---

**Scenario 2: Attempt to Add Book with Price At Threshold**

Details:
TestName: addBookWithPriceAtThreshold
Description: This test checks the behavior when the book price is exactly at the threshold value (500), which should not be added according to the business rules.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a `BookRequest` with price exactly 500.
  - Act: Invoke `addBook(bookRequest)`.
  - Assert: Check that the book is not saved in the repository.
Validation:
  - The assertion confirms that `bookRepository.save(book)` is not called.
  - This scenario is significant as it tests the boundary condition of the price rule, ensuring that books priced exactly at 500 are not added.

---

**Scenario 3: Attempt to Add Book with Price Below Threshold**

Details:
TestName: addBookWithPriceBelowThreshold
Description: This test verifies that a book with a price less than 500 is not added to the repository, adhering to the business rules.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a `BookRequest` with price less than 500.
  - Act: Invoke `addBook(bookRequest)`.
  - Assert: Ensure that the book is not saved in the repository.
Validation:
  - The assertion checks that `bookRepository.save(book)` is not called.
  - Validates the business rule that only books with prices above 500 are eligible for addition, ensuring the method adheres to intended constraints.

---

**Scenario 4: Add Book with Valid Details and Confirm Data Integrity**

Details:
TestName: addBookWithValidDetailsAndConfirmDataIntegrity
Description: This scenario tests if all provided details in `BookRequest` are correctly mapped to `Book` and saved.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a `BookRequest` with all fields set and a price above 500.
  - Act: Invoke `addBook(bookRequest)`.
  - Assert: Check that the book saved in the repository has the same details as provided in the request.
Validation:
  - The assertion validates that all details (title, price, published date) are correctly transferred from `BookRequest` to `Book`.
  - Ensures data integrity from the request to persistence, confirming that the business logic correctly handles data mapping.

---

**Scenario 5: Add Book with Missing Title**

Details:
TestName: addBookWithMissingTitle
Description: This test checks the method's behavior when the title is missing in the `BookRequest`, assuming the system allows book creation without a title.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a `BookRequest` without a title and with a valid price above 500.
  - Act: Invoke `addBook(bookRequest)`.
  - Assert: Verify that the book is still saved in the repository.
Validation:
  - The assertion checks if the book is added even without a title.
  - This test is crucial for understanding how the system handles partial data and if title is a mandatory field based on business rules. (This depends on system requirements not explicitly stated here.)

---

These scenarios cover a range of typical, boundary, and error conditions for the `addBook` method, ensuring comprehensive testing of business rules and data handling.
