  Scenario 1: Validate the setTitle method when a valid title is provided
  Details:
    TestName: testSetTitleWithValidTitle
    Description: This test is to validate the functionality of the setTitle method when a valid title is provided as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and a valid title string.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the valid title string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the title field of the instance is set to the provided title.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the title field is correctly set when a valid title is provided. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the setTitle method.
  Scenario 2: Validate the setTitle method when a null title is provided
  Details:
    TestName: testSetTitleWithNullTitle
    Description: This test is to validate the functionality of the setTitle method when a null title is provided as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the class.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with a null title.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the title field of the instance is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the title field is set to null when a null title is provided. This test is significant as it checks the method's behaviour when null inputs are provided.
  Scenario 3: Validate the setTitle method when an empty title is provided
  Details:
    TestName: testSetTitleWithEmptyTitle
    Description: This test is to validate the functionality of the setTitle method when an empty title is provided as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the class.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with an empty title.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the title field of the instance is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the title field is set to an empty string when an empty title is provided. This test is significant as it checks the method's behaviour when empty inputs are provided.
  Scenario 4: Validate the setTitle method when a title with special characters is provided
  Details:
    TestName: testSetTitleWithSpecialCharacters
    Description: This test is to validate the functionality of the setTitle method when a title containing special characters is provided as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and a title string with special characters.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the title string with special characters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the title field of the instance is set to the provided title.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the title field is correctly set even when the title contains special characters. This test is significant as it validates the method's ability to handle a variety of string inputs.
