"""
  Scenario 1: Test setting valid title value
  Details:
    TestName: testSettingValidTitleValue.
    Description: The test is meant to check the setTitle method with a valid string and verify that it successfully sets the title.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a string value to set as title.
    Act: Call the setTitle method with the initialized string.
    Assert: Use appropriate methods to get the field value and check it against the initialized string.
  Validation:
    This verifies that setTitle method properly sets the title field.
    The title field setting affects the overall object state and functionality.
  Scenario 2: Test setting null value
  Details:
    TestName: testSettingNullTitleValue.
    Description: The test ensures that setting a null string doesn't throws an exception or results in unwanted states.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set title as null.
    Act: Call the setTitle method with null.
    Assert: Use appropriate getters to confirm the title field is set to null.
  Validation:
    It's important to ensure that setTitle method handles null input gracefully, as null values might be used in many programming scenarios.
  Scenario 3: Test setting empty string
  Details:
    TestName: testSettingEmptyTitle.
    Description: The test checks if empty string can be set as a title.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set title as an empty string.
    Act: Call the setTitle method with an empty string.
    Assert: Use getters to confirm the title field is empty.
  Validation:
    An empty string is a valid input. This test ensures that setTitle method accepts and handles empty strings appropriately.

  Scenario 4: Test setting long string as title
  Details:
    TestName: testSettingLongTitle.
    Description: The test is meant to check any possible String length restrictions in the setTitle method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set title as a string of larger length (Character limit to be determined based on system constraints, for eg. more than 200 characters).
    Act: Call the setTitle method with the long string.
    Assert: Use getters to confirm the title field is the long string.
  Validation:
    The test ensures that the setTitle method can handle longer strings and there are no arbitrary limitations in place.
