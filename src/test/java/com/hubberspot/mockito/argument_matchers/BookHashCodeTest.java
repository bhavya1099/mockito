```
Scenario 1: Consistent HashCode for the Same Book Instance

Details:
  TestName: consistentHashCodeForSameBook
  Description: Ensure that multiple calls to hashCode on the same Book instance return the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book instance and set its title, price, and publishedDate.
  Act: Call hashCode method multiple times on the same Book instance.
  Assert: Assert that all calls to hashCode return the same value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Ensures that hashCode implementation is stable and consistent as per the contract of the hashCode method in Java, which is crucial for the correct operation in hash-based collections.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Consistency in hash code generation is critical for maintaining the integrity of hash-based data structures like HashSet or HashMap.

Scenario 2: Different HashCode for Books with Different Attributes

Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodeForDifferentBooks
  Description: Ensure that two Book instances with different attributes produce different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book instances with different titles, prices, and published dates.
  Act: Call hashCode on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes are different.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Validates that the hashCode method uses all relevant fields (title, price, publishedDate) to compute the hash, which is essential for proper distribution in hash-based collections.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring distinct hash codes for non-equal objects helps in efficient data retrieval and storage in hash-based structures.

Scenario 3: Same HashCode for Books with Identical Attributes

Details:
  TestName: sameHashCodeForIdenticalBooks
  Description: Test that two distinct Book instances with identical attributes (title, price, publishedDate) yield the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book instances with the same title, price, and published date.
  Act: Compute the hash code for both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes are identical.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Checks that the hashCode method correctly considers the values of title, price, and publishedDate for hash calculation, as required by the equals-hashCode contract.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensures that identical books can be correctly managed in collections that use hashing, like HashMap, which relies on consistent and accurate hash code implementation.

Scenario 4: HashCode Stability Over Time

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeStabilityOverTime
  Description: Verify that the hash code of a Book instance does not change over time if its attributes remain unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book instance and set its title, price, and publishedDate. Compute and store the initial hash code.
  Act: Repeatedly call hashCode on the same instance without changing any attributes.
  Assert: Assert that all subsequent hash codes match the initial hash code.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Ensures that the hash code is stable as long as the object's state does not change, which is crucial for its reliable use in hash-based collections.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Stability in hash code ensures that the Book objects behave predictably in collections over time, which is vital for performance and correctness in data management.
