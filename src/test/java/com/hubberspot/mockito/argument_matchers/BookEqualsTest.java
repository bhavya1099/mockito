  Scenario 1: Test if two books are identical with all fields having identical values.

  Details:
    TestName: testEqualBooks
    Description: This test is meant to check the book's 'equals' method for the scenario where two book instances with identical bookId, title, price, publishedDate, and isDigital fields are used.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two identical book instances with the same bookId, title, price, publishedDate, and isDigital values.
    Act: Invoke the 'equals' method by using one of the book instances as an argument for the other.
    Assert: Assert that the 'equals' method returns 'true'.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'equals' method can accurately identify when two book instances are identical. This test is significant as it ensures that instances with identical values are recognized as equals, helping maintain data integrity.
  Scenario 2: Test if two books with different values in any of the fields are not considered equals.
  Details:
    TestName: testDifferentBooks
    Description: This test checks the 'equals' method for the scenario where two book instances with different values in any of their fields are used.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two book instances with different values in at least one of the fields.
    Act: Invoke the 'equals' method by using one of the book instances as an argument for the other.
    Assert: Assert that the 'equals' method returns 'false'.
  Validation:
    Our test aims to validate the principle that for two books to be equal, all their fields must equal. This is critical to maintain data integrity and prevent potential discrepancies.
  Scenario 3: Test the 'equals' method for Null.

  Details:
    TestName: testNullBook
    Description: This test aims to confirm the 'equals' method when null is passed as the argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book instance.
    Act: Invoke the 'equals' method using 'null' as the argument.
    Assert: Assert that the 'equals' method returns 'false'.
  Validation:
    The test intends to validate that the 'equals' method can handle null arguments appropriately. This is critical as passing null as an argument should not result in equality.
  Scenario 4: Test the 'equals' method with two book instances of different classes.
  Details:
    TestName: testDifferentClassBooks
    Description: Testing the 'equals' method for two objects with one that's not a Book instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book instance and an instance of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the 'equals' method using the different class instance as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the 'equals' method returns 'false'.
  Validation:
    The test aims to ensure that the 'equals' method can correctly identify instances from different classes as not equal. This is significant in maintaining data integrity in a polymorphic context.
