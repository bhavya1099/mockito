  Scenario 1: Successful Date Update Test
  Details:
    TestName: successfulDateUpdate.
    Description: This test validates if the publishedDate is set correctly once the setPublishedDate method is invoked. For this test, we will use a valid LocalDate object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a LocalDate object with a valid date.
    Act: Invoke setPublishedDate method passing the instantiated LocalDate as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert if the publishedDate variable has been updated with the new date.
  Validation:
    The primary objective of this test is to confirm that the publishedDate of books can be updated successfully. The expected result is that the passed date will be successfully set as the published date of the book.
  Scenario 2: Null Date Test
  Details:
    TestName: nullDateTest.
    Description: In this test, we aim to verify the method's handling of null values. We pass a null value as the argument of the setPublishedDate method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a null LocalDate variable.
    Act: Call the setPublishedDate method passing the null variable as parameter.
    Assert: Assert if the publishedDate variable remains null.
  Validation:
    With this test, we aim to confirm that the method can handle null input gracefully. As the initial value of the publishedDate is null, passing a null argument should not change the state of the publishedDate.
  Scenario 3: Past Date Test
  Details:
    TestName: pastDateTest.
    Description: This test validates the method's competence to handle past dates. We pass an old date (a date in the past) as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a LocalDate object with a past date.
    Act: Invoke setPublishedDate method passing this past date as an argument.
    Assert: Assert if the publishedDate variable has been updated with this past date.
  Validation:
    This test checks whether our method can handle past dates as input. Although books usually get published in the past, and thus, it is a valid use case, it may cause a problem for books whose publishedDates should not be updated to a past date.

  Scenario 4: Future Date Test
  Details:
    TestName: futureDateTest.
    Description: This test verifies the method's ability to handle future dates. We pass a future date (a date yet to come) as the argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a LocalDate object with a future date.
    Act: Invoke setPublishedDate method passing this future date as an argument.
    Assert: Assert if the publishedDate variable has been updated with this future date.
  Validation:
    With this test, we aim to see how our method reacts to future dates. As future dates might not be a valid use case for a book's publishedDate this can help us catch any anomalies in handling such scenarios.
