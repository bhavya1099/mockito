Scenario 1: Check if getPublishedDate returns expected LocalDate
  Details:
    TestName: testGetPublishedDateReturnsExpectedLocalDate.
    Description: This test checks if the getPublishedDate() method returns the correct/expected LocalDate. This is important to ensure the correct date is returned when invoking the method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the publishedDate field in the Book object with a known LocalDate (e.g., LocalDate.of(2021, 11, 30)).
    Act: Call the getPublishedDate() method on the Book object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned LocalDate is equal to the one we first set.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getPublishedDate() method correctly returns the date we first set. This is important as it validates whether or not the method is functioning as expected.
Scenario 2: Check if getPublishedDate returns null when date not set
  Details:
    TestName: testGetPublishedDateReturnsNullWhenNotSet.
    Description: This test checks if the getPublishedDate() method returns null when no publishedDate value has been set. This is important to ensure null is returned when invoking the method on a new Book object which has no published date yet.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Start with a new Book object with no publishedDate value set.
    Act: Call the getPublishedDate() method on the Book object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    This test is meant to verify that the getPublishedDate() method correctly returns null when no date has been set. This is significant as it correctly indicates that no published date has yet been assigned.
Scenario 3: Check if getPublishedDate returns correct value after changing the date
  Details:
    TestName: testGetPublishedDateReturnsCorrectValueAfterChange.
    Description: This test checks if the getPublishedDate() method returns the correct value after the initial publishedDate has been changed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the publishedDate field in the Book object. Now change the published date to a new value.
    Act: Call the getPublishedDate() method on the Book object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned LocalDate is equal to the newly set value.
  Validation:
    This assertion checks if the getPublishedDate() method correctly returns the updated value. This is important as it checks the mutability of the publishedDate field and demonstrates the expected behaviour of the getPublishedDate() method.
