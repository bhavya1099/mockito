Scenario 1: Set a Valid Positive Price
Details:
  TestName: setValidPositivePrice
  Description: This test checks if the setPrice method correctly updates the price of a book when provided with a valid positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a positive integer value, for example, 150.
  Assert: Assert that the price field of the Book instance is updated to 150.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the price field is correctly updated to reflect the new price. This test is significant as it confirms the basic functionality of the setPrice method, ensuring that it handles typical, valid inputs correctly.
Scenario 2: Set a Price of Zero
Details:
  TestName: setPriceToZero
  Description: This test verifies whether the setPrice method can handle and correctly set the price to zero, which might represent free or promotional items.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a value of 0.
  Assert: Assert that the price field of the Book instance is updated to 0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the price can be set to zero, which is a valid scenario for free books or promotions. This test is important to ensure that the system can handle edge cases of pricing.
Scenario 3: Set a Negative Price
Details:
  TestName: setNegativePrice
  Description: This test checks how the setPrice method handles a negative input, which is generally not a valid price for a book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a negative value, e.g., -100.
  Assert: Assert that the price field of the Book instance is not updated to a negative value or that an appropriate error handling mechanism is triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that negative values are either not accepted or handled properly, preventing invalid data states. This test is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing potential misuse or logical errors in pricing.
Scenario 4: Set a Very Large Price
Details:
  TestName: setExtremelyHighPrice
  Description: This test examines the behavior of the setPrice method when provided with a very high integer value, testing the upper limits of price handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a very large integer value, e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Assert: Assert that the price field of the Book instance is updated to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the capability of the setPrice method to handle extremely high values. This test is important for ensuring the robustness of the system under extreme conditions.
These scenarios collectively ensure that the setPrice method is thoroughly tested across a range of valid and edge case inputs, confirming both its functionality and its resilience.
