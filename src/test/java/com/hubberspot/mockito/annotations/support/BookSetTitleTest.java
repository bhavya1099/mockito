Here are the test scenarios for the `setTitle` method:
**Scenario 1: Setting a Valid Title**
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithValidInput
  Description: Tests that the `setTitle` method correctly sets a valid title.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `bookId`, `price`, and `publishedDate` set to some default values.
  Act: Call `setTitle` with a valid title string.
  Assert: Verify that the `title` field has been updated with the expected value using `assertEquals`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the `setTitle` method correctly updates the `title` field when given a valid input. This is important to ensure that the book's title can be accurately set and retrieved.
**Scenario 2: Setting a Null Title**
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithNullInput
  Description: Tests that the `setTitle` method handles a null title input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `bookId`, `price`, and `publishedDate` set to some default values.
  Act: Call `setTitle` with a null title.
  Assert: Verify that the `title` field has been set to null using `assertNull`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the `setTitle` method can handle a null input without throwing any exceptions. This is important to ensure that the method is robust and can handle unexpected input.
**Scenario 3: Setting an Empty Title**
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithEmptyInput
  Description: Tests that the `setTitle` method handles an empty title input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `bookId`, `price`, and `publishedDate` set to some default values.
  Act: Call `setTitle` with an empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the `title` field has been set to an empty string using `assertEquals`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the `setTitle` method can handle an empty input without throwing any exceptions. This is important to ensure that the method is robust and can handle unexpected input.
**Scenario 4: Setting a Title with Special Characters**
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Tests that the `setTitle` method correctly sets a title with special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `bookId`, `price`, and `publishedDate` set to some default values.
  Act: Call `setTitle` with a title containing special characters (e.g.!, @, #, $, etc.).
  Assert: Verify that the `title` field has been updated with the expected value using `assertEquals`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the `setTitle` method correctly handles titles with special characters. This is important to ensure that the method can handle a wide range of input values.
**Scenario 5: Setting a Title with Non-English Characters**
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithNonEnglishCharacters
  Description: Tests that the `setTitle` method correctly sets a title with non-English characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `bookId`, `price`, and `publishedDate` set to some default values.
  Act: Call `setTitle` with a title containing non-English characters (e.g. á, é, ñ, etc.).
  Assert: Verify that the `title` field has been updated with the expected value using `assertEquals`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the `setTitle` method correctly handles titles with non-English characters. This is important to ensure that the method can handle a wide range of input values.
