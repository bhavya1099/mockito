  Scenario 1: Test for Null Published Date
  Details:
    TestName: testForNullPublishedDate
    Description: This test is designed to check whether the getPublishedDate method returns null when the publishedDate field has not been initialized.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a book object without setting the publishedDate field.
    Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the book object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario where the publishedDate field is null. This is crucial since not all books may have a published date set at the time of object creation.
  Scenario 2: Test for Non-Null Published Date
  Details:
    TestName: testForNonNullPublishedDate
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the getPublishedDate method correctly returns the date that was set as the published date for the book.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a book object and set a specific date as the published date.
    Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the book object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned date is the same as the date that was set as the published date.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns the published date that was set for the book. This is critical for maintaining accurate information about the book.
  Scenario 3: Test for Default Published Date
  Details:
    TestName: testForDefaultPublishedDate
    Description: This test is designed to check whether the getPublishedDate method returns the current date when the publishedDate field has been initialized but not explicitly set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a book object and initialize the publishedDate field without setting a specific date.
    Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method on the book object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned date is the current date.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario where the publishedDate field has been initialized but not explicitly set. This is important for handling cases where a book's published date may not be known at the time of object creation.
