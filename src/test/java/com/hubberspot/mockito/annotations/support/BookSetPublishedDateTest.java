"""
Scenario 1: Testing the setPublishedDate method with a valid date.
Details:
  TestName: testValidDateInput.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the setPublishedDate method correctly sets the published date when given a valid LocalDate input.
Execution:
  Arrange: We create a valid LocalDate variable with the current date.
  Act: We call the setPublishedDate method with the LocalDate variable as the argument.
  Assert: We use a getter (not shown in this snippet) to assert that the date set by the setPublishedDate method matches the date we passed as an argument.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the setPublishedDate method correctly sets the date when given a valid argument. This is significant for ensuring the publishedDate field always reflects the correct data.
Scenario 2: Testing the setPublishedDate method with a future date.
Details:
  TestName: testFutureDateInput.
  Description: This test is designed to check how setPublishedDate method handles dates in the future. Assuming it is valid for a book to be set with a published date in future.
Execution:
  Arrange: We create a LocalDate variable with a date one year in the future.
  Act: We call the setPublishedDate method with the future LocalDate variable as the argument.
  Assert: We assert that the date set by the setPublishedDate method matches the future date we passed as an argument.
Validation:
  This assertion validates that the setPublishedDate method correctly handles future dates. This is significant for maintaining accurate future book release dates.
Scenario 3: Testing the setPublishedDate method with a null value.
Details:
  TestName: testNullDateInput.
  Description: Test to check how the setPublishedDate method handles a null input. Given the current code, it is expected to accept the null without throwing any exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: We create a LocalDate variable assigned to null.
  Act: We call the setPublishedDate method with the null LocalDate variable as the argument.
  Assert: We assert that the publishedDate field is indeed null after the method call.
Validation:
  This assertion serves to verify that the setPublishedDate method can handle null values, which is important for validating data before persisting in the database.
