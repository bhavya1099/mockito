"""
Scenario 1: Test if getTitle method returns correct title
Details:
  TestName: doesGetTitleReturnCorrectTitle
  Description: This test is designed to confirm that the getTitle method returns the correct title that has been set previously.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class is created and the title field is set to a predefined value.
  Act: The getTitle method is invoked on the instance.
  Assert: The returned value from the getTitle method is compared to the previously set value.
Validation:
  This scenario validates that the getTitle method correctly returns the set value of the title field, ensuring that the getter method is functioning as expected.
Scenario 2: Test if getTitle method returns null when no title set
Details:
  TestName: doesGetTitleReturnNullWhenNoTitleSet
  Description: This test is meant to validate that the getTitle method returns null when no title field has been set prior to the method call.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class is created without setting the title field.
  Act: The getTitle method is invoked on the instance.
  Assert: The returned value from the getTitle method is checked if it is null.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms that the getTitle method returns null when no value has been set to the title field. This checks that the method behaves correctly under such circumstances.
Scenario 3: Test getTitle method with empty title field
Details:
  TestName: doesGetTitleReturnEmptyStringWhenTitleIsEmpty
  Description: This test checks the situation where the title field has been initialized but has been set to an empty string. The getTitle method should accordingly return an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class is created with the title field set to an empty string.
  Act: The getTitle method is invoked on the instance.
  Assert: The returned value from the getTitle method is compared to an empty string.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the getTitle method's behavior when the title field is set to an empty string. It ensures that the method is accurately conveying the state of the title field in such instances.
Scenario 4: Test getTitle method with a title string consists of whitespace
Details:
  TestName: doesGetTitleReturnWhitespaceWhenTitleIsWhitespace
  Description: The test checks whether the getTitle method would return a string consisting only of white spaces when the title field has been set as such.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class is created, and the title field is set to a string of white spaces.
  Act: The getTitle method is invoked on the instance.
  Assert: The returned value from the getTitle method is compared to a string of white spaces.
Validation:
  The scenario aims to verify that the getTitle method can handle situations where the title field is a string of white spaces.
  This test is significant as inputs having leading, trailing, or multiple spaces in a row can sometimes cause issues in software systems.
