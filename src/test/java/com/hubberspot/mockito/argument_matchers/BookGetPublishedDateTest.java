Scenario 1: Valid Published Date Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: verifyPublishedDateRetrieval
  Description: Test to ensure that the getPublishedDate method correctly returns the date that was set using setPublishedDate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Book and set a specific LocalDate using setPublishedDate.
  Act: Retrieve the published date using getPublishedDate.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the retrieved date matches the date that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that getPublishedDate accurately returns the exact LocalDate object that was set using setPublishedDate. This test is significant to confirm the integrity and reliability of date retrieval in the Book entity.

Scenario 2: Default Published Date

Details:
  TestName: verifyDefaultPublishedDateIsNull
  Description: Test to check if the published date of a new Book instance is null by default, assuming no date has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Book without setting the published date.
  Act: Retrieve the published date using getPublishedDate.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the retrieved date is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the default state of publishedDate is null if it has not been explicitly set. This test is important to ensure that the Book entity handles uninitialized dates correctly.

Scenario 3: Published Date Immutability Check

Details:
  TestName: verifyPublishedDateImmutability
  Description: Test to ensure that the LocalDate returned by getPublishedDate cannot be altered externally to affect the internal state of the Book entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Book, set a LocalDate, retrieve it, and attempt to modify the retrieved LocalDate object.
  Act: Modify the retrieved LocalDate object (e.g., adding days) and then retrieve the published date again from the book.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the original published date remains unchanged.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that modifications to the retrieved LocalDate do not affect the internal state of the Book entity. This test is significant for ensuring data encapsulation and integrity within the Book entity.

Scenario 4: Consistency Across Multiple Retrieves

Details:
  TestName: verifyConsistencyOfMultiplePublishedDateRetrievals
  Description: Test to confirm that multiple calls to getPublishedDate return the same result each time when the published date has not been altered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Book, set a specific published date.
  Act: Retrieve the published date multiple times.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that all retrieved dates are identical.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the consistency and reliability of the getPublishedDate method. This test is important to ensure that the method is free of side effects that could alter the returned value on subsequent calls.
