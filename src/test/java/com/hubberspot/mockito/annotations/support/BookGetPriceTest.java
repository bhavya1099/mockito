Scenario 1: Test to ensure correct book price is returned
Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is used to ensure that the getPrice method returns the correct price of the book.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a book object and set its price to a known value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the book instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price returned versus the known price set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method correctly returns the price of the book. If the expected and actual values match, it confirms the correct functionality of the getter method in accessing the private field.

Scenario 2: Test to check getter on uninitialized book object
Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceOnUninitializedBookObject
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the getPrice method can handle being invoked on an uninitialized book object (where price has not been set).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an uninitialized book object (do not set the price value).
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the uninitialized book instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the returned price is 0 or null.
  Validation:
    The aim of this test is to verify how the getPrice method behaves when invoked on an uninitialized book object. This scenario is significant as it checks the robustness of the getPrice method in handling such edge cases.
Scenario 3: Test to verify the independence of getPrice method
Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceIndependence
  Description: This test is to verify that the getPrice method is independent and is not affected by changes to other fields of the book object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a book object, set its price and change the values of other fields like title, bookId and publishedDate.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the book instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the returned price matches the initially set price.
  Validation:
    This test asserts that the getPrice method is independent and is not influenced by other fields in the book object. This is important to ensure decoupling and abidance of encapsulation principle in the object-oriented design.
