"""
Scenario 1: Positive Scenario - Set a regular title
Details:
  TestName: setTitleRegular
  Description: This test is meant to check the regular usage of the setTitle method. We set a normal, non-empty title to the book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a regular String as "Java Programming Manual" to title.
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the created title.
  Assert: Assert that the title of the book is "Java Programming Manual".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setTitle method correctly sets the book title. The reason for the expected result is the regular usage of the method with valid data. This test is significant because it validates the most common usage of the setTitle method.
Scenario 2: Negative Scenario - Set title with null
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithNull
  Description: This test checks the setTitle method when passing null as the parameter. The function is expected to set the book title as null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set null to title.
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with null as parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the title of the book is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setTitle method correctly sets the book title as null if null is set. The reason for the expected result is that we don't have any null check in the given method. The test is significant in terms of validating negative scenarios and checking the code's robustness.
Scenario 3: Edge Case - Set the title with an empty string
Details:
  TestName: setTitleWithEmptyString
  Description: This test is intended to check the edge case where the setTitle method is called with an empty string as the parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an empty string to title.
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the empty string as parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the title of the book is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setTitle method correctly sets the book title as an empty string when called with an empty string. The reason for the expected result is based on the method's behaviour. This test is important in terms of testing edge cases that the method may encounter.
