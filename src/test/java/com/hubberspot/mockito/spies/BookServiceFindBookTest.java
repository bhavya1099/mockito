ROOST_METHOD_HASH=findBook_3572cb3c72
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=findBook_b1a97d8bf0
Scenario 1: Test when the bookId is valid
Details:
  TestName: findBookWithValidId.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the findBook method is able to find a book with a valid bookId.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a bookId that exists in the book repository.
    Act: Invoke the findBook method with the valid bookId.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual book returned against the expected book.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method is able to find and return the correct book when a valid bookId is passed. The expected result is the correct book from the repository. This test is significant in ensuring that the method is functioning correctly in normal conditions.
Scenario 2: Test when the bookId is invalid
Details:
  TestName: findBookWithInvalidId.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the findBook method is able to handle the scenario where an invalid bookId is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a bookId that does not exist in the book repository.
    Act: Invoke the findBook method with the invalid bookId.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an exception when an invalid bookId is passed. This behavior is expected because the method should not be able to find a book with an invalid Id. This test is significant in ensuring that the method is able to handle error conditions correctly.
Scenario 3: Test when the bookId is null
Details:
  TestName: findBookWithNullId.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the findBook method is able to handle the scenario where a null bookId is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a bookId as null.
    Act: Invoke the findBook method with the null bookId.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an exception when a null bookId is passed. This behavior is expected because the method should not accept null parameters. This test is significant in ensuring that the method is able to handle error conditions correctly.
