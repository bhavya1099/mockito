Scenario 1: Test for Positive Price Value
Details:
  TestName: testSetPositivePrice.
  Description: This test is intended to verify whether the setPrice method can successfully set a positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the price value to a positive integer, for instance, 100.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the set positive integer.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the price was successfully set and is equal to the positive integer.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the price was set correctly. The expected result is that the price is equal to the positive integer. This test is significant to ensure that the application can handle and correctly store positive price values.
Scenario 2: Test for Negative Price Value
Details:
  TestName: testSetNegativePrice.
  Description: This test is intended to check if the setPrice method can handle negative price values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the price value to a negative integer, for instance, -100.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the set negative integer.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the price was not set and is not equal to the negative integer.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the price was not set to a negative value. The expected result is that the price is not equal to the negative integer. This test is significant to ensure that the application does not accept negative price values.
Scenario 3: Test for Zero Price Value
Details:
  TestName: testSetZeroPrice.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the setPrice method can handle a price value of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the price value to zero.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the set zero value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the price was successfully set and is equal to zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the price was correctly set to zero. The expected result is that the price is zero. This test is significant to ensure that the application can handle and correctly store a price value of zero.
Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Integer Value
Details:
  TestName: testSetMaxIntegerPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method can handle the maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the price value to the maximum integer value.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the set maximum integer value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the price was successfully set and is equal to the maximum integer value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the price was correctly set to the maximum integer value. The expected result is that the price is equal to the maximum integer value. This test is significant to ensure that the application can handle and correctly store the maximum possible price value.
