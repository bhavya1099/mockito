### Scenario 1: Title Field is Null
**Details:**
  - TestName: getTitleWhenTitleIsNull
  - Description: Test to verify that the getTitle method returns null when the title field is not set (null by default as per class field declaration).
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Instantiate the object without setting the title field.
  - Act: Call the getTitle method on the instantiated object.
  - Assert: Check if the returned value is null.
**Validation:**
  - This test confirms that the method correctly handles and returns null when the title field is not initialized. It validates the method's ability to handle default uninitialized states, which is crucial for ensuring robustness in scenarios where the title might not be set.
### Scenario 2: Title Field Contains Empty String
**Details:**
  - TestName: getTitleWhenTitleIsEmpty
  - Description: Test to check the behavior of the getTitle method when the title field is set to an empty string.
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Instantiate the object and set the title field to an empty string.
  - Act: Call the getTitle method on the instantiated object.
  - Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
**Validation:**
  - This test checks that the getTitle method can correctly return an empty string, which is a valid state for a String type in Java. This scenario is important for applications that might interpret empty titles differently from null titles.
### Scenario 3: Title Field Contains Non-Empty String
**Details:**
  - TestName: getTitleWhenTitleIsNonEmpty
  - Description: Test the getTitle method's output when the title field has a non-empty string value.
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Instantiate the object and set the title field to "Effective Java".
  - Act: Call the getTitle method on the instantiated object.
  - Assert: Assert that the returned value matches "Effective Java".
**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the getTitle method correctly retrieves the value of the title when it is properly set. This is critical for confirming data integrity and correct data retrieval methods in the application.
### Scenario 4: Title Field After Modification
**Details:**
  - TestName: getTitleAfterTitleIsModified
  - Description: Test the getTitle method after the title field has been changed from its initial value.
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Instantiate the object, set the title field to "Initial Title", then modify it to "Updated Title".
  - Act: Call the getTitle method on the instantiated object.
  - Assert: Assert that the returned value is "Updated Title".
**Validation:**
  - This test verifies that the getTitle method reflects updates to the title field, which is necessary for applications where the state of an object might change over time. It ensures that the method remains accurate and reliable across object lifecycle changes.
