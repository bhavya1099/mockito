ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setPublishedDate_d374eca684
Scenario 1: Check if the date is set correctly
  Details:
    TestName: testSetValidPublishedDate.
    Description: Ensure that the method adequately sets the correct date after invoking it.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a LocalDate object with a valid date.
    Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the LocalDate object as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the publishedDate has been correctly set to the provided LocalDate value.
  Validation:
    The validation is to ascertain that the method correctly sets the provided date as the published date. It is critical for the correct functioning of the object since it reflects the object's actual publication date.
Scenario 2: Check method when a null date is passed
  Details:
    TestName: testSetNullDate.
    Description: Validate the method's behavior when provided a null LocalDate object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required.
    Act: Call the setPublishedDate method with null as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the publishedDate is null.
  Validation:
   Verify that the method doesn't throw any error when passed a null value. This is significant as it tests the method's ability to handle null inputs and ensuring that it doesn't cause a NullPointerException.
Scenario 3: Check what happens when the method is invoked with a future date
  Details:
    TestName: testSetFutureDate.
    Description: Check the method's action when called with a future date.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Declare a LocalDate object with a future date.
    Act: Invoke the setPublishedDate method with the LocalDate object.
    Assert: Assert that the publishedDate is set as the future date.
  Validation:
    The validation is to confirm that the method appropriately sets the provided future date as the published date. This might not be a common use case but could happen and hence it is essential to validate such scenarios.
