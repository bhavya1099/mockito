### Scenario 1: Book Price Below Threshold

Details:
  TestName: addBookWithPriceBelowThreshold
  Description: Validates that the addBook method does not save the book when its price is less than or equal to 500.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with a price of 500.
  Act: Call the addBook method with this book.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository's save method is not called.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the save method is not invoked for books priced at or below 500. This is significant as the business logic dictates not processing cheaper books, possibly to focus on higher-value transactions.

### Scenario 2: Book Price Above Threshold

Details:
  TestName: addBookWithPriceAboveThreshold
  Description: Ensures that the addBook method saves the book when its price is above 500.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with a price of 501.
  Act: Call the addBook method with this book.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository's save method is called exactly once with the correct book.
Validation:
  This test confirms that books priced above 500 are correctly saved to the repository, adhering to the intended business logic of handling more valuable books.

### Scenario 3: Book Price Exactly at Threshold

Details:
  TestName: addBookWithPriceExactlyAtThreshold
  Description: Tests whether the addBook method treats books priced exactly at 500 as below the threshold and thus does not save them.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with a price of 500.
  Act: Call the addBook method with this book.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository's save method is not called.
Validation:
  This test checks the boundary condition at the price point of 500, ensuring that the system behaves consistently at the edge of the specified business rule.

### Scenario 4: Null Book Object

Details:
  TestName: addBookWithNullBookObject
  Description: Tests the addBook method's behavior when a null book object is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a null Book object.
  Act: Call the addBook method with the null object.
  Assert: Ensure no exception is thrown and the method completes gracefully.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the system's robustness and checks that passing a null reference doesn't lead to unexpected crashes or behavior, which is crucial for maintaining application stability.

### Scenario 5: High Price Book Persistence Verification

Details:
  TestName: verifyHighPriceBookPersistence
  Description: Confirms that a book with a price well above the threshold is actually persisted in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with a high price (e.g., 1000).
  Act: Call the addBook method with this book.
  Assert: Mock the repository and verify that save is called with the book having the expected attributes.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that high-value books are not only intended to be saved but are actually being persisted correctly with their attributes intact, which ties directly to data integrity and application reliability.
