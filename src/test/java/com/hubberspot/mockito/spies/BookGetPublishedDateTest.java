"""
Scenario 1: Test for Default Published Date
Details:
  TestName: testDefaultPublishedDate.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the default published date is null as initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to arrange any data as we're checking the default value.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned published date is null.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the default value of the publishedDate is null. This is significant as it ensures the initial state of the object is as expected.
Scenario 2: Test for Non-Null Published Date
Details:
  TestName: testNonNullPublishedDate.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPublishedDate method returns the correct date when the publishedDate is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the publishedDate to a specific date.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned published date is the same as the one set.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPublishedDate method correctly returns the date that was set. This is important for ensuring the integrity of the data in the object.
Scenario 3: Test for Published Date Consistency
Details:
  TestName: testPublishedDateConsistency.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPublishedDate method returns the same date when called multiple times without any changes to the publishedDate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the publishedDate to a specific date.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method multiple times.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned published date is the same for each call.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPublishedDate method is consistent in its return values. This is important to ensure the method is idempotent and does not have any side effects.
Scenario 4: Test for Published Date After Modification
Details:
  TestName: testPublishedDateAfterModification.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPublishedDate method returns the updated date after the publishedDate has been modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the publishedDate to a specific date, then change it to a different date.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned published date is the new date.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPublishedDate method correctly reflects changes to the publishedDate. This is crucial for ensuring the object accurately represents the current state of the data.
