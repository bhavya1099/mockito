```
Scenario 1: Verify isDigital returns true for a digital book

Details:
  TestName: verifyIsDigitalTrueForDigitalBook
  Description: This test checks whether the isDigital method correctly identifies a book as digital when the isDigital field is set to true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Book and set the digital flag to true using the setDigital method.
  Act: Call the isDigital method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that isDigital correctly returns true for a digital book, validating the method's ability to reflect the book's digital status accurately.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensures that the system correctly identifies and handles digital books, which may have different processing or availability characteristics in the application.

Scenario 2: Verify isDigital returns false for a non-digital book

Details:
  TestName: verifyIsDigitalFalseForNonDigitalBook
  Description: This test checks whether the isDigital method correctly identifies a book as non-digital when the isDigital field is set to false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Book and set the digital flag to false using the setDigital method.
  Act: Call the isDigital method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that isDigital correctly returns false for a non-digital book, validating the method's ability to reflect the book's non-digital status accurately.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensures that the system correctly identifies and handles non-digital books, which may require different logistics or availability considerations.

Scenario 3: Verify isDigital consistency across multiple calls

Details:
  TestName: verifyIsDigitalConsistency
  Description: This test ensures that the isDigital method returns consistent results across multiple invocations for the same book instance, without any state changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Book and set the digital flag to a fixed value (true or false).
  Act: Call the isDigital method multiple times on the same Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that all results are the same.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks for consistency in the output of isDigital, ensuring that the method's return value is stable over time when the book's digital status has not changed.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Important for ensuring reliable behavior in parts of the application that may check the digital status of a book multiple times during processing.
```
These scenarios ensure thorough testing of the isDigital method in various contexts, validating its correctness and reliability within the system.
