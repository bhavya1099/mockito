"""
  Scenario 1: Valid Book ID Case
  Details:
    TestName: testSetBookIdWithValidId.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly sets a valid Book Id. A valid book ID is a non-null and non-empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the Book object. Define a valid book ID.
    Act: Invoke the setBookId method with the valid book ID as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the bookId was set correctly.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly set the valid book ID. If the process is successful, we can confirm that the method accurately sets an attribute of the object. This is significant in ensuring accurate data is stored in each Book object.
  Scenario 2: Null Book ID Case
  Details:
    TestName: testSetBookIdWithNullId.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles a null Book Id. It is expected to handle the scenario gracefully and not crash.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the Book object.
    Act: Invoke the setBookId method with 'null' as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the bookId was set as null or another default value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the method handled the null input without crashing and initiated an appropriate fail-safe, such as setting it to a default value. This is significant in preventing null pointer exceptions and ensuring the program's robustness.
  Scenario 3: Empty Book ID Case
  Details:
    TestName: testSetBookIdWithEmptyId.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles an empty Book Id. It is expected to handle the scenario gracefully and not crash.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the Book object.
    Act: Invoke the setBookId method with an empty string as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the bookId was set as an empty string or another default value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the method handled the empty string input without crashing and initiated an appropriate fail-safe, such as setting it to a default value. This is significant in preventing errors related to empty strings and ensuring the program's robustness.
