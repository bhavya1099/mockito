```
Scenario 1: Adding an empty list of books

Details:
  TestName: addEmptyListOfBooks
  Description: Tests whether the addBooks method can handle an empty list without throwing errors or exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty List of Book objects.
  Act: Invoke the addBooks method with the empty list.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository.saveAll method was called with an empty list.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify that the method can gracefully handle empty inputs without side effects.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test to ensure the method's robustness and stability in edge cases.

Scenario 2: Adding a list with multiple books

Details:
  TestName: addMultipleBooks
  Description: Tests if the addBooks method correctly saves a list containing multiple Book objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a List of Book objects with more than one entry.
  Act: Invoke the addBooks method with this list.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository.saveAll method was called with the correct list of books.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify that all books in the list are being passed to the repository for saving.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test to confirm that the method handles collections of items properly.

Scenario 3: Adding a list with null values

Details:
  TestName: addListWithNullValues
  Description: Tests the behavior of the addBooks method when the list contains null entries.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a List of Book objects that includes at least one null entry.
  Act: Invoke the addBooks method with this list.
  Assert: Check for the handling of null values, such as ignoring them or throwing an exception.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify how the method handles potential null values within a list.
  Elaborate on the importance of the test to ensure the method's reliability and error handling capabilities.

Scenario 4: Adding books with varied properties

Details:
  TestName: addBooksWithVariedProperties
  Description: Tests if the addBooks method can handle books with different attributes, such as varying prices, titles, and publication dates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of Book objects with varied properties.
  Act: Invoke the addBooks method with this list.
  Assert: Verify that the bookRepository.saveAll method is called with the intended books, maintaining their properties.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify that the method respects the individual properties of each book.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test to ensure that diverse book data is correctly processed and saved.

Scenario 5: Adding a null list

Details:
  TestName: addNullList
  Description: Tests how the addBooks method reacts when called with a null instead of a list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a null reference for the list.
  Act: Invoke the addBooks method with a null list.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate handling such as throwing an IllegalArgumentException.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the method's behavior when encountering null as input.
  Elaborate on the importance of the test to ensure that the method can safely handle or reject invalid inputs.

/*
The failure in the `addNullList` test method is due to the expectation that an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown when a `null` list of books is passed to the `addBooks` method of the `BookService` class. However, the `addBooks` method, as implemented, does not contain any explicit null check or handling that throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when a null input is provided. Instead, it directly attempts to save the null list using the `bookRepository.saveAll(books)` method call.

Since the `addBooks` method does not handle the null case by throwing an exception, and presumably the underlying repository method (`saveAll`) also does not throw an `IllegalArgumentException` for a null input (or it's not being caught and re-thrown as such), the test fails because the expected exception is not thrown.

To resolve this test failure, you would need to modify the `addBooks` method in the `BookService` class to include a null check and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the `books` parameter is null. This would align the method behavior with the test's expectation, thereby allowing the test to pass.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void addNullList() {
    List<Book> books = null;
    IllegalArgumentException thrown = assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        bookService.addBooks(books);
    });
    assertNotNull(thrown);
}
