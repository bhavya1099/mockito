Scenario 1: Validation of null published date
Details:
  TestName: validateNullPublishedDate
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle null publishedDate values. As the publishedDate can sometimes be null (before publishing), it is important to check the functioning in this scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class without setting a published date.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate() method on the object.
  Assert: The returned value should be null.
Validation:
  The function should be able to handle null published dates without throwing any exception and return the null value.
  Understanding how the method behaves when encountering null values is crucial for ensuring robust, error-free method behavior.
Scenario 2: Check correct date return
Details:
  TestName: checkPublishedDateReturnType
  Description: This test aims to ensure that the getPublishedDate method correctly returns the published date of a book in LocalDate format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class and set a published date.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate() method on the object.
  Assert: The returned value should be the same as the published date that was set. The value should be a LocalDate object.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method not only returns the correct value but also ensures it is of the correct type (i.e. LocalDate).
  This is significant in validating the method's functionality of retrieving the book's published date in a specific format.
Scenario 3: Validate unchanged published date
Details:
  TestName: validateUnchangedPublishedDate
  Description: This test aims to ensure the immutability of the published date. The original value should remain intact even after performing multiple operations on the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class, set a published date, and perform several operations on other data members.
  Act: Invoke the getPublishedDate() method on the object.
  Assert: The returned value should be the same as the published date that was originally set.
Validation:
  The function should ensure that the published date remains unchanged, regardless of the operations done on other data members of the class.
  This is important to maintain data integrity and consistency across the application.
