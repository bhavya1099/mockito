"""
Scenario 1: Validate getTitle method when title is set
Details:
    TestName: validateGetTitleWhenTitleIsSet.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getTitle() method returns the correct title when it is set.
Execution:
    Arrange: A title "Java Programming" is set to the book object.
    Act: Invoke getTitle() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned title is "Java Programming".
Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getTitle() method correctly fetches the title of the book when it is set. This behavior is essential for accurately retrieving a book's details.
Scenario 2: Validate getTitle method when multiple books have different titles
Details:
    TestName: validateGetTitleForMultipleBooks.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getTitle() method returns the correct titles for multiple book instances.
Execution:
    Arrange: Multiple book objects are created with different titles.
    Act: Invoke getTitle() for each book object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned title for each book is as expected.
Validation:
    This assertion aims to validate getTitle() functionality across multiple book instances. This is necessary to ensure that book instances do not interfere with each other's details.
Scenario 3: Validate getTitle method when title is not set
Details:
    TestName: validateGetTitleWhenTitleIsNotSet.
    Description: This test is meant to check if getTitle() returns null when the title is not set.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book object without setting a title.
    Act: Invoke getTitle() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned title is null.
Validation:
    The aim is to assure that if the title is not set, the getTitle() method returns null. This is logical considering the title's initial value is null. Verifying this behavior ensures that the method does not return incorrect or unexpected values when the title is not set.
Scenario 4: Validate getTitle method for title value with maximum limit
Details:
    TestName: validateGetTitleForMaxLengthTitle.
    Description: This test is meant to check if getTitle() method returns the correct title even when the title has a maximum length.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book object with a title that has a maximum length.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned title is the same as the one set, despite its length.
Validation:
    This assertion ensures that the getTitle() method correctly handles titles with maximum length. The significance of this test lies in assuring that the method can handle large input sizes.
Scenario 5: Validate getTitle method's behavior after title is updated
Details:
    TestName: validateGetTitleAfterTitleUpdate.
    Description: This test is meant to check if getTitle() method returns the updated title after the title of a book object is updated.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book object and set an initial title. Update the title to a new value.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned title is the updated one, not the initial title.
Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getTitle() method fetches the latest value when the title is updated, rather than returning the outdated value. This behavior is crucial to ensure the object's state is accurately represented.
