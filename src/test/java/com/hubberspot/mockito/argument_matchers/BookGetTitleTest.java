"""
  Scenario 1: Test for the null Title.
  Details:
    TestName: getTitleWhenTitleIsNull.
    Description: When the title is not set i.e., it is null, then the getTitle method should return null. This test executes this scenario to ensure correct behavior when the title is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the "title" field to null.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method.
    Assert: The returned value must be null.
  Validation:
    This verifies that the getTitle method correctly handles null values and doesn't throw an exception. It verifies the null-safety of the method which is vital for robustness of the application.
  Scenario 2: Test with a non-empty Title.
  Details:
    TestName: getTitleWhenTitleIsSet.
    Description: The getTitle method should return the stored value when title is set. This test verifies this functionality.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the "title" field with a non-empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method.
    Assert: The returned value must match the set title value.
  Validation:
    This validates the primary functionality of the getTitle method; to accurately retrieve the stored title. This is crucial as book titles are key details in the library context.

  Scenario 3: Test with an empty Title.
  Details:
    TestName: getTitleWhenTitleIsEmpty.
    Description: When title is a blank string, the getTitle method should return an empty string. This scenario tests this condition.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the "title" field with an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method.
    Assert: The returned value should be an empty string.
  Validation:
    This affirms the method's capability to return accurate results in contexts that might be perceived as edge cases, like where title is an empty string rather than null. This is important for method consistency and reliability.
