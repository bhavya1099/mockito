Here are the generated test scenarios for the `getPublishedDate` method:
Scenario 1: Get Published Date When Published Date is Not Null
Details:
  TestName: getPublishedDateReturnsNonNullValue
  Description: This test checks if the method returns the published date when it is not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a non-null published date.
  Act: Call the `getPublishedDate` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned date is not null and matches the expected value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns the correct published date when it is set. This is crucial in scenarios where the published date is used for filtering or sorting books.
Scenario 2: Get Published Date When Published Date is Null
Details:
  TestName: getPublishedDateReturnsNullValue
  Description: This test checks if the method returns null when the published date is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null published date.
  Act: Call the `getPublishedDate` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned date is null.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns null when the published date is not set, which is essential in preventing NullPointerExceptions in downstream code.
Scenario 3: Get Published Date with Different Date Values
Details:
  TestName: getPublishedDateReturnsCorrectDate
  Description: This test checks if the method returns the correct published date for different date values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create instances of the class with different published dates (e.g., yesterday, today, tomorrow).
  Act: Call the `getPublishedDate` method for each instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned dates match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns the correct published date for various date values, which is vital in scenarios where date-based filtering or sorting is performed.
Scenario 4: Get Published Date with Edge Case Dates
Details:
  TestName: getPublishedDateReturnsEdgeCaseDates
  Description: This test checks if the method returns the correct published date for edge case dates (e.g., January 1, 1970, December 31, 9999).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create instances of the class with edge case published dates.
  Act: Call the `getPublishedDate` method for each instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned dates match the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns the correct published date for edge case dates, which is essential in scenarios where date-based calculations or comparisons are performed.
Scenario 5: Get Published Date with Date Formats
Details:
  TestName: getPublishedDateReturnsDateInCorrectFormat
  Description: This test checks if the method returns the published date in the correct format (e.g., ISO_LOCAL_DATE).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a published date.
  Act: Call the `getPublishedDate` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned date is in the correct format.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns the published date in a format that can be easily consumed by other parts of the application or external systems.
