  Scenario 1: Validate the setTitle method with a valid title
  Details:
    TestName: validateSetTitleWithValidTitle.
    Description: The test is meant to check the functionality of the setTitle method when a valid title is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class and a valid string to be used as a title.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class and an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the empty string as an argument.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title field of the object is equal to the empty string.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the setTitle method correctly sets the title field of the object even when an empty string is provided. This is important to ensure that the title of a book can be set to an empty string if needed.
  Scenario 3: Validate the setTitle method with a null value
  Details:
    TestName: validateSetTitleWithNullValue.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with null as an argument.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title field of the object is null.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the setTitle method correctly sets the title field of the object to null when a null value is provided. This is important to ensure that the title of a book can be set to null if needed.

  Details:
    TestName: validateSetTitleWithLongString.
    Description: The test is meant to check the functionality of the setTitle method when a very long string is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class and a very long string.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the long string as an argument.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title field of the object is equal to the long string.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the setTitle method correctly sets the title field of the object even when a very long string is provided. This is important to ensure that the title of a book can accommodate long titles.
