"""
  Scenario 1: Positive price value testing.
  Details:
    TestName: setPositivePrice.
    Description: This test is meant to check proper behavior of the setPrice method when provided with a positive price value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a positive integer as price.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method.
    Assert: Check whether the price field of the class has been updated with the provided value.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the setPrice method correctly updates the price value when it is positive. The expected result is the successful update of the price field, significance of this test is to ensure correct price update in normal conditions.
  Scenario 2: Testing functionality with zero price value.
  Details:
    TestName: setZeroPrice.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setPrice method when it is given a zero value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a zero as price.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method.
    Assert: Check whether the price field of the class has been updated correctly with zero.
  Validation:
    This test will verify that the setPrice method correctly handles zero price value. The expected outcome is that the price field should be updated successfully with a zero.
  Scenario 3: Negative price value testing.
  Details:
    TestName: setNegativePrice.
    Description: This test validates the behavior of the setPrice method when input value is negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a negative integer as price.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method.
    Assert: Check for an exception or error, because negative price is invalid.
  Validation:
    The aim of this test is to validate that setPrice method doesn't allow negative price values which are unrealistic for a price field. The expected output is an occurrence of an exception or error.
  Scenario 4: Large value testing.
  Details:
    TestName: setLargePriceValue.
    Description: The test is designed to check the behavior of setPrice method when assigned with a very large value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a very large integer as price.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method.
    Assert: Check whether the price field of the class has been updated correctly.
  Validation:
    The goal of this test is to confirm that the setPrice method can handle large values correctly. The test is significant for ensuring the robustness of the program.
